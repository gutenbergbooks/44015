<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This critical edition of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> was undertaken as
a Thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree
of Ph.D. at Princeton University. It was compiled under
the guidance and direction of Professor T.&nbsp;M. Parrott of that
institution, and every page of it is indebted to him for suggestion,
advice, and criticism. I can but inadequately indicate the scope
of his painstaking and scholarly supervision, and can even less
adequately express my appreciation of his ever-patient aid, which
alone made this work possible.</p>

<p>I desire also to acknowledge my debt to Professor J. Duncan
Spaeth of Princeton University, for his valuable suggestions in
regard to the presentation of my material, notably in the Introduction;
also to Professor T.&nbsp;W. Baldwin of Muskingum College
and Mr. Henry Bowman, both of them then fellow graduate
students of mine at Princeton, for assistance on several occasions
in matters of special inquiry; and to Dr. M.&nbsp;W. Tyler of the
Princeton Department of History for directing me in clearing up
a lego-historical point; and finally to the libraries of Yale and
Columbia Universities for their kind loan of needed books.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In the Stationer’s Register the following entry is recorded
under the date of “30º Martij 1632:”</p>

<p class="hang">CONSTABLE Entred for his copy vnder the hands of Sir
HENRY HERBERT and master <i>SMITHWICKE</i> warden
a Tragedy called <cite>the ffatall Dowry</cite>. Vj&nbsp;d.</p>

<p>In the year 1632 was published a quarto volume whose title-page
was inscribed: <cite>The Fatall Dowry</cite>: a Tragedy: As it hath
been often Acted at the Private House in Blackfriars, by his
Majesties Servants. Written by P.&nbsp;M. and N.&nbsp;F. London,
Printed by John Norton, for Francis Constable, and are to be
sold at his shop at the Crane, in Pauls Churchyard. 1632.</p>

<p>That the initials by which the authors are designated stand for
Philip Massinger and Nathaniel Field is undoubted.</p>


<h3 id="later-texts">Later Texts</h3>

<p>There is no other seventeenth century edition of <cite>The Fatal
Dowry</cite>. It was included in various subsequent collections, as
follows:</p>

<ul class="numbered">
  <li><span class="item">I.</span> <cite>The Works of Philip Massinger</cite>—edited by Thomas Coxeter,
  1759—re-issued in 1761, with an introduction by T. Davies.</li>

  <li><span class="item">II.</span> <cite>The Dramatic Works of Philip Massinger</cite>—edited by John
  Monck Mason, 1779.</li>

  <li><span class="item">III.</span> <cite>The Plays of Philip Massinger</cite>—edited by William Gifford,
  1805. There was a revised second edition in 1813, which
  is still regarded as the Standard Massinger Text, and was
  followed in subsequent editions of Gifford.</li>

  <li><span class="item">IV.</span> <cite>Modern British Drama</cite>—edited by Sir Walter Scott, 1811.
  The text of this reprint of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> is Gifford’s.</li>

  <li><span class="item">V.</span> <cite>Dramatic Works of Massinger and Ford</cite>—edited by Hartley
  Coleridge, 1840 (<i>et seq.</i>). This follows the text of Gifford.</li>

  <li><span class="item">VI.</span> <cite>The Plays of Philip Massinger.</cite> From the Text of William
  Gifford. With the Addition of the Tragedy Believe as
  You List. Edited by Francis Cunningham, 1867 (<i>et seq.</i>).
<a id="page-2" href="#page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"> </a>
  The Fatal Dowry in this edition, as in the preceding, is a
  mere reprint of the Second Edition of Gifford.</li>

  <li><span class="item">VII.</span> <cite>Philip Massinger.</cite> Selected Plays. (Mermaid Series.)
  Edited by Arthur Symons, 1887–9 (<i>et seq.</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> appeared in <cite>The
Plays of Philip Massinger</cite>, adapted for family reading and the
use of young persons, by the omission of objectionable passages,—edited
by Harness, 1830–1; and another expurgated version
was printed in the <cite>Mirror of Taste and Dramatic Censor</cite>, 1810.
Both of these are based on the text of Gifford.</p>

<p>The edition of Coxeter is closest of all to the Quarto, following
even many of its most palpable mistakes, and adding some
blunders on its own account. Mason accepts practically all of
Coxeter’s corrections, and supplies a great many more variants
himself, not all of which are very happy. Both these eighteenth
century editors continually contract for the sake of securing
a perfectly regular metre (e.&nbsp;g.: <i>You’re</i> for <i>You are</i>, <a href="#line-I-i-135">I, i, 139</a>;
<i>th’ honours</i> for <i>the honours</i>, <a href="#line-I-ii-35">I, ii, 35</a>; etc.), while Gifford’s tendency
is to give the full form for even the contractions of the
Quarto, changing its <i>’em’s</i> to <i>them’s</i>, etc. Gifford can scarce
find words sharp enough to express his scorn for his predecessors
in their lack of observance of the text of the Quarto, yet he himself
frequently repeats their gratuitous emendations when the
original was a perfectly sure guide, and he has almost a mania
for tampering with the Quarto on his own account. Symons’
<i>Mermaid</i> text, while based essentially on that of Gifford, in a
number of instances departs from it, sometimes to make further
emendations, but more often to go back from those of Gifford to
the version of the original, so that on the whole this is the best
text yet published.</p>

<p>There has been a German translation by the Graf von Baudisson,
under the title of <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Unselige Mitgift</cite>, in his <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ben Jonson
und seine Schule</cite>, Leipsig, 1836; and a French translation, in
prose, under the title of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La dot fatale</cite> by E. Lafond in <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contemporains
de Shakespeare</cite>, Paris, 1864.</p>


<h3 id="date">Date</h3>

<p>The date of the composition or original production of <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite> is not known. The Quarto speaks of it as having
<a id="page-3" href="#page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"> </a>
been “often acted,” so there is nothing to prevent our supposing that
it came into existence many years before its publication. It does
not seem to have been entered in Sir Henry Herbert’s Office
Book.<a id="marker-1" href="#footnote-1" class="marker" title="Footnote 1">1</a> This would indicate its appearance to have been prior to
Herbert’s assumption of the duties of his office in August, 1623.
In seeking a more precise date we can deal only in probabilities.<a id="marker-2" href="#footnote-2" class="marker" title="Footnote 2">2</a></p>

<p><a id="page-4" href="#page-4" class="pagenum" title="4"> </a>
The play having been produced by the King’s Men, a company
in which Field acted, it was most probably written during his
association therewith. This was formed in 1616; the precise
date of his retirement from the stage is not known. His name
appears in the patent of March 27, 1619, just after the death of
Burbage, and again and for the last time in a livery list for his
Majesty’s Servants, dated May 19, 1619. It is absent from the
next grant for livery (1621) and from the actors’ lists for various
plays which are assigned to 1619 or 1620. We may therefore
assume safely that his connection with the stage ended before the
close of 1619. On the basis of probability, then, the field is narrowed
to 1616–19.<a id="marker-3" href="#footnote-3" class="marker" title="Footnote 3">3</a></p>

<p>More or less presumptive evidence may be adduced for a yet
more specific dating. During these years that Field acted with
the King’s Men, two plays appeared which bear strong internal
evidence of being products of his collaboration with Massinger
and Fletcher: <cite>The Knight of Malta</cite> and <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite>.
While several parallels of phraseology are afforded for <cite>The Fatal
Dowry</cite> by these (as, indeed, by every one of the works of Massinger)
they are not nearly so numerous or so striking as similarities
discoverable between it and certain other dramas of the
Massinger <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i>. With none does the connection seem so intimate
as with <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite>. Both plays open with a
scene in which a young suppliant for a father’s cause is counseled,
in passages irresistibly reminiscent of each other, to lay aside
pride and modesty for the parent’s sake, because not otherwise
can justice be gained, and it is the custom of the age to sue for it
shamelessly. Moreover, the offer by Beaufort and his associates
<a id="page-5" href="#page-5" class="pagenum" title="5"> </a>
to Malefort of any boon he may desire as a recompense for his
service, and his acceptance of it, correspond strikingly in both
conduct and language with the conferring of a like favor upon
Rochfort by the Court (<a href="#line-I-ii-255">I, ii, 258</a> ff.); while the request which
Malefort prefers, that his daughter be married to Beaufort Junior,
and the language with which that young man acknowledges this
meets his own dearest wish, bear a no less patent resemblance to
the bestowal of Beaumelle upon Charalois (<a href="#line-II-ii-280">II, ii, 284–297</a>). Now
this last parallel is significant, because <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite> is
an unaided production of Massinger, while the analogue in <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite> occurs in a scene that is by the hand of Field. The
similarity may, of course, be only an accident, but presumably it
is not. Then did Field borrow from Massinger, or did Massinger
from Field? The most plausible theory is that <cite>The Unnatural
Combat</cite> was written immediately after <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>,
when Massinger’s mind was so saturated with the contents of the
tragedy just laid aside that he was liable to echo in the new drama
the expressions and import of lines in the old, whether by himself
or his collaborator. That at any rate the chronological relationship
of the two plays is one of juxtaposition is further attested by
the fact that in minor parallelisms,<a id="marker-4" href="#footnote-4" class="marker" title="Footnote 4">4</a> too, to <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>, <cite>The
Unnatural Combat</cite> is richer than any other work of Massinger.</p>

<p>Unfortunately <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite> is itself another play of
whose date no more can be said with assurance than that it preceeds
the entry of Sir Henry Herbert into office in 1623, though
its crude horrors, its ghost, etc., suggest moreover that it is its
author’s initial independent venture in the field of tragedy, his
<cite>Titus Andronicus</cite>, an ill-advised attempt to produce something
after the “grand manner” of half a generation back. Next in
closeness to <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> among the works of Massinger as
regards the number of its reminiscences of phraseology stands his
share of <cite>The Virgin Martyr</cite>; next in closeness as regards the
<a id="page-6" href="#page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"> </a>
<em>strikingness</em> of these parallels stands his share of <cite>The Little
French Lawyer</cite>. These two plays can be dated <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1620.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>To sum up:</p>

<p><cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> appears to antedate the installation of Sir
Henry Herbert in 1623.</p>

<p>It was probably written while Field was with the King’s Men;
with whom he became associated in 1616, and whom he probably
quitted in 1619.</p>

<p>The indications point to its composition during the latter part
of this three-year period (1616–19), for it yields more and
closer parallels to <cite>The Virgin Martyr</cite> and <cite>The Little French
Lawyer</cite>, dated about 1620, than to <cite>The Knight of Malta</cite> and <cite>The
Queen of Corinth</cite>, dated 1617–8,—closer, indeed, than to any
work of Massinger save one, <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite>, itself an
undated but evidently early play, with which its relationship is
clearly of the most intimate variety.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>The following (at best hazardously conjectural) scheme of
sequence may be advanced:</p>

<p>Fletcher and Massinger and Field together wrote <cite>The Knight
of Malta</cite> and <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite>—according to received
theory, in 1617 or 1618. Thereafter, the last two collaborators
(desirous, perhaps, of trying what they could do unaided and
unshackled by the dominating association of the chief dramatist
of the day) joined hands in the production of the tragedy which
is the subject of our study. Then, upon Field’s retirement, Massinger
struck off, with <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite>, into unassisted
composition; but we next find him, whether because he recognized
the short-comings of this turgid play or for other reasons, again
in double harness, at work upon <cite>The Virgin Martyr</cite> and <cite>The
Little French Lawyer</cite>. On this hypothesis, <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>
would be dated 1618–9.</p>


<h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

<p>No source is known for the main plot of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>. A
Spanish original has been suspected, but it has never come to
light. The stress laid throughout the action on that peculiarly
Spanish conception of “the point of honor” (see under <a href="#critical-estimate" class="smcap">Critical Estimate</a>,
<a id="page-7" href="#page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"> </a>
in consideration of the character of Charalois) is unquestionably
suggestive of the land south of the Pyrenees, and
we have an echo of <cite>Don Quixote</cite> in the exclamation of Charalois
(<a href="#line-III-i-440">III, i, 441</a>): “Away, thou curious impertinent.” The identification,
however, of the situation at Aymer’s house in <a href="#act-IV-ii">IV, ii</a> with a
scene in Cervantes’ <i>El viejo celoso</i> (Obras Completas De Cervantes,
Tomo XII, p.&nbsp;277) is extremely fanciful. The only similarity
consists in the circumstance that in both, while the husband
is on the stage, the wife, who, unknown to him, entertains a lover
in the next room, is heard speaking within. But this is a spontaneous
outcry on the part of Beaumelle, who does not suspect
the proximity of her husband, and her discovery follows, and
from this the denouement of the play; whereas in Cervantes’
<i>entremes</i> the wife deliberately calls in bravado to her niece, who
is also on-stage, and boasts of her lover,—and the husband thinks
this is in jest, and nothing comes of it but comedy.</p>

<p>The theme of the son’s redemption of his father’s corpse by his
own captivity is from the classical story of Cimon and Miltiades,
as narrated by Valerius Maximus, De dictis factisque memorabilibus,
etc. Lib. V, cap. III. De ingratis externorum: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bene egissent
Athenienses cum Miltiade, si eum post trecenta millia Persarum
Marathone devicta, in exilium protinus misissent, ac non in carcere
et vinculis mori coegissent; sed, ut puto, hactenus saevire
adversus optime meritum abunde duxerunt: immo ne corpus quidem
eius, sic expirare coacti sepulturae primus mandari passi
sunt, quam filius eius Cimon eisdem vinculis se constrigendum
traderet. Hanc hereditatem paternam maximi ducis filius, et futurus
ipse aetatis suae dux maximus, solam se crevisse, catenas et
carcerem, gloriari potuit.</i></p>

<p>In the version of Cornelius Nepos (Vitae, Cimon I) Cimon is
incarcerated against his will.</p>

<p>The action of the play is given the historical setting of the later
fifteenth century wars of Louis XI of France and Charles the
Bold of Burgundy, although this background is extremely hazy.
The hero’s name is the title which Charles bore while heir-apparent
to the Duchy of Burgundy; mention is made of Charles
himself (“The warlike Charloyes,” <a href="#line-I-ii-170">I, ii, 171</a>), to Louis (“the

“the more desperate Swisse” (<a href="#line-I-ii-120">I, ii, 124</a>), against whom Charles
<a id="page-8" href="#page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"> </a>
lost his life and the power of Burgundy was broken; while the
three great defeats he suffered at their hands, Granson, Morat,
Nancy, are named in <a href="#line-I-ii-170">I, ii, 170</a>. Shortly after these disasters the
events which the play sets forth must be supposed to occur; the
parliament by which in our drama Dijon is governed was established
by Louis XI when he annexed Burgundy in 1477 and
thereby abolished her ducal independence.</p>


<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>

<p>It is doubtful if Massinger ever collaborated with any author
whose manner harmonized as well with his own as did Field’s.
In his partnership with Decker in <cite>The Virgin Martyr</cite>, the
alternate hands of the two dramatists afford a weird contrast.<a id="marker-5" href="#footnote-5" class="marker" title="Footnote 5">5</a>
His union with Fletcher was less incongruous, but Fletcher was
too much inclined to take the bit between his teeth to be a comfortable
companion in double harness,<a id="marker-6" href="#footnote-6" class="marker" title="Footnote 6">6</a> and at all times his volatile,
prodigal genius paired ill with the earnest, painstaking, not
over-poetic moralist. But in Field Massinger found an associate
whose connection with himself was not only congenial, but even
beneficial, to the end that together they could achieve certain results
of which either was individually incapable; just as it has
been established was the case in the Middleton-Rowley collaboration.
To a formal element of verse different, indeed, from Massinger’s,
but not obtrusively so, a certain moral fibre of his own
(perhaps derived from his clerical antecedents), and a like familiarity
with stage technique, Field added qualities which Massinger
notably lacked, and thereby complemented him: a light and vigorous
(if sometimes coarse) comic touch as opposed to Massinger’s
cumbrous humor; a freshness and first-hand acquaintance
with life as opposed to Massinger’s bookishness; a capacity
<a id="page-9" href="#page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"> </a>
to visualize and individualize character as opposed to Massinger’s
weakness for drawing types rather than people. The fruit of
their joint endeavors testifies to a harmonious, conscientious, and
mutually respecting partnership.</p>

<p>In consideration of the above, it is surprising how substantially
in accord are most of the opinions that have been expressed concerning
the share of the play written by each author.</p>

<p>“A critical reader,” says Monck Mason, “will perceive that
Rochfort and Charalois speak a different language in the Second
and Third Acts, from that which they speak in the first and last,
which are undoubtedly Massinger’s; as is also Part of the Fourth
Act, but not the whole of it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ireland, in a postscript to the text of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> in
Gifford’s edition, agrees with Mason in assigning the Second Act
to Field and also the First Scene of the Fourth Act; the Third
Act, however, he claims for Massinger, as well as that share of
the play with which Mason credits him. Fleay and Boyle, the
chief modern commentators who have taken up the question of
the division of authorship with the aid of metrical tests and other
criteria, agree fairly well with the speculations of their less scientific
predecessors, and adopt an intermediate, reconciling position
on the disputed Third Act, dividing it between the two dramatists.<a id="marker-7" href="#footnote-7" class="marker" title="Footnote 7">7</a></p>

<p>Boyle (<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Englische Studien</cite>, V, 94) assigns to Massinger <a href="#act-I">Act I</a>;
<a href="#act-III">Act III</a> as far as line 316; <a href="#act-IV-ii">Act IV, Scenes ii</a>, <a href="#act-IV-iii">iii</a>, and <a href="#act-IV-iv">iv</a>; and the
whole of <a href="#act-V">Act V</a>, with the exception of <a href="#line-V-ii-80">Scene ii, lines 80–120</a>,
which he considers an interpolation of Field, whom he also believes
to have revised the latter part of <a href="#act-I-ii">I, ii</a> (from <i>Exeunt Officers
with Romont</i> to end).</p>

<p>Fleay (<cite>Chron. Eng. Dra.</cite>, I<!--TN: was printed italic-->, 208) exactly agrees with this
division save that the latter part of <a href="#act-I-ii">I, ii</a>, which Boyle believes
emended by Field, he assigns to that author outright; and that he
places the division in Act III twenty-seven lines later (Field after
<i>Manent Char. Rom.</i>).</p>

<p><a id="page-10" href="#page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"> </a>
In my own investigation I have used for each Scene the following
tests to distinguish the hands of the two authors:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Broad aesthetic considerations: the comparison of style
and method of treatment with the known work of either dramatist.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The test of parallel phrases. Massinger’s habit of repeating
himself is notorious. I have gone through the entire body of
his work, both that which appears under his name, and that which
has been assigned to him by modern research in the Beaumont &amp;
Fletcher plays, and noted all expressions I found analogous to
any which occur in <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>. I have done the same for
Field’s work, examining his two comedies, <cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite>
and <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>, and Acts I and V of <cite>The Knight of
Malta</cite> and III and IV of <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite>, which the consensus
of critical opinion recognizes (in my judgment, correctly)
as his. He is generally believed to have collaborated also in <cite>The
Honest Man’s Fortune</cite>, but the exact extent of his work therein
is so uncertain that I have not deemed it a proper field from
which to adduce evidence. His hand has been asserted by one
authority or another to appear in various other plays of the
period, he having served, as it were, the role of a literary scapegoat
on whom it was convenient to father any Scene not identified
as belonging to Beaumont, Fletcher, or Massinger; but there is no
convincing evidence for his participation in the composition of
any extant dramas save the above named.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Metrical tests. I have computed the figures for <cite>The Fatal
Dowry</cite> in regard to double or feminine endings and run-on lines.
Massinger’s verse displays high percentages (normally 30 per
cent, to 45 per cent.) in the case of either. Field’s verse varies
considerably in the matter of run-on lines at various periods of
his life, but the proportion of them is always smaller than Massinger’s.
His double endings average about 18 per cent. I have
also counted in each Scene the number of speeches that end within
the line, and that end with the line, respectively. (Speeches ending
with fragmentary lines are considered to have mid-line endings.)
This is declared by Oliphant (<cite>Eng. Studien</cite>, XIV, 72)
the surest test for the work of Massinger. “His percentage of
speeches,” he says, “that end where the verses end is ordinarily
as low as 15.” This is a tremendous exaggeration, but it is true
<a id="page-11" href="#page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"> </a>
that the ratio of mid-line endings is much higher in Massinger
than in any of his contemporaries—commonly 2:1, or higher.</p>

<p>We find the <a href="#act-I-i">First Scene of Act I</a> one of those skillful introductions
to the action which the “stage-poet” knew so well how to
handle, for which reason, probably, he was generally intrusted
with the initial Scene of the plays in which he collaborated.
Thoroughly Massingerian are its satire upon the degenerate age
and its grave, measured style, rhetorical where it strives to be
passionate, and replete with characteristic expressions. Especially
striking examples of the dramatist’s well-known and never-failing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for the recurrent use of certain ideas and phrases are:
<i>As I could run the hazard of a check for’t.</i> (<a href="#line-I-i-10">l.&nbsp;10</a>)—cf. <a id="marker-8" href="#footnote-8" class="marker" title="Footnote 8">8</a>C-G. 87 b,
156 b, 327 b; D. V, 328; XI, 28;—<i>You shall o’ercome.</i> (<a href="#line-I-i-100">l.&nbsp;101</a>)—cf.
C-G. 230 b, 248 b, 392 a;—and <a href="#line-I-i-180">ll.&nbsp;183–7</a>—cf. C-G. 206 a, 63 a,
91 a, 134 b. The correspondence between <a href="#line-I-i-80">ll.&nbsp;81–99</a> and the
opening of <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite> has already been remarked
on, while further reminiscences of the same passage are to be
found elsewhere in Massinger (C-G. 104 a, 195 b). Metrical
tests show for the Scene 33 per cent. double endings and 29 per
cent. run-on lines, figures which substantiate the conclusions
derivable from a scrutiny of its style and content.<a id="marker-9" href="#footnote-9" class="marker" title="Footnote 9">9</a></p>

<p>In <a href="#act-I-ii">I, ii</a> Massinger appears in his element, an episode permitting
opportunities for the forensic fervor which was his especial forte.
Such Scenes occur again and again in his plays: the conversion
of the daughters of Theophilus by the Virgin Martyr, the plea of
the Duke of Milan to the Emperor, of old Malefort to his judges
in <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite>, of Antiochus to the Carthagenian
senate in <cite>Believe as You List</cite>. From the speech with which Du

judgment</i>; <i>Speak to the cause</i>; <i>I foresaw this</i> (an especial favorite

</div>

<p>We have seen that the hand of Field has been asserted to
appear in the last half of this Scene. This is probably due to the
presence here of several rhymed couplets, which are uncommon
in Massinger save as tags at the end of Scenes or of impressive
speeches, but not absolutely unknown in his work; whereas Field
employs them frequently—in particular to set off a gnomic utterance.
If Field’s indeed, they can scarcely represent more than
his revising touch here and there; everything else in this part of
the Scene bespeaks Massinger no less clearly than does the portion
which preceeds it. There continues the same stately declamation,
punctuated at intervals by brief comments or replies, the
same periodic sentence-structure, the same or even greater frequency
of characteristic diction. Massinger again and again
refers in his plays to the successive hardships of the summer’s
heat and winter’s frost (<a href="#line-I-ii-180">l.&nbsp;184</a>—cf. C-G. 168 b, 205 a, 392 b,
488 b); <i>stand bound</i> occurs literally scores of times upon his

<p class="continued">and the general likeness of <a href="#line-I-ii-255">l.&nbsp;258</a> ff. with C-G. 44 b-45 a, as above
noted. Nor do the verse tests reveal any break in the continuity
of the Scene; the figures for the first part are: double endings,
45 per cent.; run-on lines, 33 per cent.—for the second part:
double endings, 36 per cent.; run-on lines, 36 per cent.</p>

<p>Passing to the <a href="#act-II">Second Act</a>, we discover at once a new manner
of expression, in which the sentence has a looser structure, the
verse a quicker <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">tempo</i>, the poetry a striving now and again for a
note of lyric beauty which, although satisfactorily achieved in but
few lines, is by Massinger’s verse not even attempted. A liberal
sprinkling of rhymes appears. The Scene is a trifle more vividly
conceived; the emotions have a somewhat more genuine ring.
Simultaneously, resemblances to the phraseology of Massinger’s
other plays become infrequent; <em>and, to increase the wonder</em>, is
almost the only reminder of him in the whole of Scene i. On the
other hand we must not expect to find in the work of Field the
same large number of recognizable expressions as mark that of
Massinger; for he was not nearly so given to repeating himself,
nor are there many of his plays extant from which to garner parallels.
The figure of speech with which Charalois opens his
funeral address [Field shows a great predilection for “aqueous”
similes and metaphors], the liberal use of oaths (<i>’Slid</i>, <i>’Slight</i>),
<a id="page-14" href="#page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"> </a>
a reference (<a href="#line-II-i-135">l.&nbsp;137</a>) to the Bermudas (also mentioned in <cite>Amends
for Ladies</cite>: M. 427), and the comparison to the oak and pine
(<a href="#line-II-i-115">ll.&nbsp;119–121</a>—cf. a Field Scene of <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite>: D. V,
436–7) are the only specific minutia to which a finger can be
pointed. The verse analysis testifies similarly to a different
author from that of Act I, double endings being 20 per cent.,
run-on lines 15 per cent.—figures which are quite normal to Field.</p>

<p>To the actor-dramatist may be set down the prose of <a href="#act-II-ii">II, ii</a>
without question. Massinger practically never uses prose, which
is liberally employed by Field, as is the almost indistinguishable
prose-or-verse by which a transition is made from one medium to
the other. The dialogue between Beaumelle and her maids is
strikingly like that between two “gentlewomen” in <cite>The Knight
of Malta</cite>, I, ii—a Scene generally recognized as by his hand; the
visit of Novall Junior which follows is like a page out of his
earlier comedies. Notable resemblances are ll.&nbsp;177–8, <i>Uds-light!
my lord, one of the purls of your band is, without all discipline,
fallen out of his rank</i>, with <i>I have seen him sit discontented
a whole play because one of the purls of his band was
fallen out of his reach to order again</i>. (<cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>, M.
455); and <a href="#line-II-ii-100">l.&nbsp;104</a>, <i>they skip into my lord’s cast skins some twice
a year</i>, with <i>and then my lord</i> (<i>like a snake</i>) <i>casts a suite every
quarter, which I slip into</i>: (<cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite>, M. 374).
The song, after <a href="#line-II-ii-130">l.&nbsp;131</a>, recalls that in <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>, M. 465.</p>

<p>Of the verse which follows, most of the observations made in
regard to the preceeding Scene are applicable. The comic touch
in the midst of Romont’s tirade (<a href="#line-II-ii-170">ll.&nbsp;174–206</a>) against old Novall,
when the vehemence of his indignation leads him to seek at every
breath the epithet of a different beast for his foe, is surely
Field’s, not Massinger’s. A Field scene of <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite>,
D. V, 438, parallels with its <i>Thou a gentleman! thou an ass</i>, the
construction of <a href="#line-II-ii-275">l.&nbsp;276</a>, while there too is duplicated the <i>true-love
knots</i> of <a href="#line-II-ii-310">l.&nbsp;314</a>, though in a rather grotesque connection. The
verse tests are confirmative of Field: 21 per cent. double endings;
19 per cent, run-on lines. While a few resemblances to
phrases occurring somewhere in the works of Massinger can be
marked here and there in the 355 lines of the Scene, they are not
such as would demand consideration, nor are more numerous
than sheer chance would yield in the case of a writer so prolific as
<a id="page-15" href="#page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"> </a>
the “stage-poet.” The parallel between <a href="#line-II-ii-280">ll.&nbsp;284–297</a> and a passage
from <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite> is pointed out under the head of
<a href="#date" class="smcap">Date</a>, and one of several possible explanations for this coincidence
is there offered. These lines in <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> are as
unmistakably Field’s as any verse in the entire play; their short,
abruptly broken periods and their rapid flow are as characteristic
of him as the style of their analogue in <cite>The Unnatural Combat</cite> is
patently Massingerian.</p>

<p><a href="#act-III">Act III</a> presents a more difficult problem. It will be noted
that Fleay and Boyle alike declare that its single long Scene is
divided between the two authors, but are unable to agree as to the
point of division. The first 316 lines are beyond question the
work of Massinger. The tilt between Romont and Beaumelle is
conducted with that flood of rhetorical vituperation by which he
customarily attempts to delineate passion; in no portion of the
play is his diction and sentence-structure more marked; and the
parallels to passages elsewhere in his works reappear with redoubled
profusion. Indeed, they become too numerous for complete
citation; let it suffice to refer <a href="#line-III-i-40">ll.&nbsp;43–4</a> to D. III, 477; <a href="#line-III-i-50">ll.&nbsp;53–4</a>
to C-G. 173 a; <a href="#line-III-i-80">ll.&nbsp;80–3</a> to D. III, 481; <a href="#line-III-i-100">l.&nbsp;104</a> to C-G. 532 a;
<a href="#line-III-i-115">l.&nbsp;116</a> to C-G. 146 b; <a href="#line-III-i-115">ll.&nbsp;117–8</a> to D. VI, 294 and D. VI, 410;
<a href="#line-III-i-230">ll.&nbsp;232–5</a> to C-G. 307 a, also to 475 b, and to D. VIII, 406; while
the phrase, <i>Meet with an ill construction</i> (<a href="#line-III-i-235">l.&nbsp;238</a>) is a common
one with Massinger (cf. C-G. 76 a, 141 b, 193 b, 225 b, 339 b), as
are such ironic observations as the <i>Why, ’tis exceeding well</i> of <a href="#line-III-i-290">l. 293</a>
(cf., e.&nbsp;g., 175 b). This part of the Scene contains 45 per
cent. double endings and 36 per cent. run-on lines.</p>

<p>The last 161 lines of the Act with scarcely less certainty can be
established as Field’s, though on a first reading one might imagine,
from the wordiness of the vehement dialogue and the rather high
ratio (19:11) of speeches ending in mid-line, that the hand of
Massinger continues throughout. But the closest examination
no longer will reveal traces of that playwright’s distinctive handiwork,
while a ratio of 17 per cent. for double endings and 28 per
cent. for run-on lines, the introduction of rhyme, the oaths, and
the change from the previous full-flowing declamation to shorter,
more abrupt periods are vouchers that this part of the Scene is
from the pen of the actor-dramatist. We can scarcely imagine
<a id="page-16" href="#page-16" class="pagenum" title="16"> </a>
the ponderous-styled Massinger writing anything so easy and
rapid as</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-24">I’ll die first.</div>
<div class="line">Farewell; continue merry, and high heaven</div>
<div class="line">Keep your wife chaste.</div>
</div>

<p class="continued">Such phrases as <i>So I not heard them</i> (<a href="#line-III-i-350">l.&nbsp;352</a>) and <i>Like George
a-horseback</i> (<a href="#line-III-i-430">l.&nbsp;433</a>) in the loose structure of the one and the
slangy scurrility of the other, exhibit no kinship to his manner;
<a href="#line-III-i-370">l.&nbsp;373</a>, <i>They are fools that judge me by my outward seeming</i>
recalls a Field passage in <cite>The Queen of Corinth</cite> (D. V, 444)
<i>They are fools that hold them dignified by blood</i>. There is here
and there, moreover, a certain violence of expression, a compressed
over-trenchancy of phrase, that brings to mind the rant
of the early Elizabethans, and is found among the Jacobeans only
in the work of Rowley, Beaumont, and Field. For the last
named, this is notably exemplified in the opening soliloquy of <cite>The
Knight of Malta</cite>; we cannot but recognize the same touch here in
<a href="#line-III-i-385">ll.&nbsp;386–8</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-20">Thou dost strike</div>
<div class="line">A deathful coldness to my heart’s high heat,</div>
<div class="line">And shrink’st my liver like the calenture.</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Something I must do</i>, which concludes the Act, is repeatedly
paralleled in Massinger’s plays, but a similar indefinite
resolve is expressed in <cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite> (M. 363), and it
consequently cannot be adduced as evidence of his hand. Immediately
above, however (<a href="#line-III-i-490">ll.&nbsp;494–6</a>), we encounter, in the allusion
to the Italian and Dutch temperaments, a thought twice echoed by
the “stage-poet” in plays of not greatly later date, <cite>The Duke of
Milan</cite> and <cite>The Little French Lawyer</cite> (C-G. 90 a; D. III, 505).
It may represent an interpolation by Massinger; it may be merely
that this rather striking conclusion to the climatic speech of his
collaborator’s scene so fixed itself on his mind as to crop out
afterwards in his own productions.</p>

<p>In the short disputed passage (<a href="#line-III-i-315">ll.&nbsp;317–343</a>) which separates
what is undoubtedly Massinger’s from what is undoubtedly
Field’s, it would appear that both playwrights had a hand. The
<i>’Sdeath and Gads me!</i>, the play upon the word <i>currier</i>, and the
<a id="page-17" href="#page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"> </a>
phrase, <i>I shall be with you suddenly</i> (cf. <cite>Q. of Cor.</cite> D. V, 467)
speak for Field; while Massinger, on the other hand, parallels</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-24">His back</div>
<div class="line">Appears to me as it would tire a beadle;</div>

</div>

<p class="continued">and the phrase “to sit down with a disgrace” occurs something
like a dozen times on his pages, especially frequently in the collaborated
plays—that is to say, in the earlier period of his work,
to which <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> belongs. It is probable, and not unnatural,
that the labors of the partners in composition overlapped
on this bit of the Scene, but metrical analysis claims with as much
certainty as can attach to this test in the case of so short a
passage that it is substantially Massinger’s, and should go rather
with what preceeds than with what comes after it, the verse being
all one piece with that of the former section. It has 37 per cent.
double endings and 41 per cent. run-on lines.</p>

<p><a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i,</a> opens with a prose passage for all the world like that of
<cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite>, I, ii, with its picture of the dandy, his
parasites, and the pert page who forms a sort of chorus with his
caustic <i>asides</i>; and writes itself down indisputably as by the same
author. Novall Junior and his coterie appear here as in their
former presentation in <a href="#act-II-ii">II, ii</a>. We have again the same racy
comedy, the same faltering of the vehicle between verse and prose
(see <a href="#line-IV-i-60">ll.&nbsp;61–8</a>; <a href="#line-IV-i-135">137–153</a>). After the clearing of the stage of all
save Romont and young Novall, uninterrupted verse ensues,
which, despite a rather notable parallel in <cite>The Beggars’ Bush</cite>,
D. IX, 9 to  <a href="#line-IV-i-170">l.&nbsp;174</a>, is evidently Field’s also. An analogue of  <a href="#line-IV-i-180">ll.
180–1</a> is discoverable in <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite> (M. 421), as is of
the reference ( <a href="#line-IV-i-195">l.&nbsp;197</a>) to “fairies’ treasure” in <cite>Woman is a
Weathercock</cite> (M. 344). Novall’s exclamation ( <a href="#line-IV-i-180">l.&nbsp;182</a>), <i>Pox of
this gun!</i> and his retort ( <a href="#line-IV-i-200">l.&nbsp;201</a>), <i>Good devil to your rogueship!</i>
are Fieldian, and the entire passage possesses a vigor and an easy
naturalness which declare his authorship. It is not improbable,
however, that his contribution ends with the fragmentary  <a href="#line-IV-i-205">l.&nbsp;207</a>,
and that the remaining four lines of the Scene are a Massinger
<a id="page-18" href="#page-18" class="pagenum" title="18"> </a>
tag. <cite>The Maid of Honour</cite> (C-G. 28 a) furnishes a striking
parallel for  <a href="#line-IV-i-205">ll.&nbsp;208–9</a>, while for  <a href="#line-IV-i-210">210–1</a> cf. C-G. 192 a. The
metrical tests for <a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i</a>, confirm Field: 22 per cent. double endings;
22 per cent. run-on lines.</p>

<p>With the next Scene the hand of Massinger is once more in
evidence with all its accustomed manifestations. One interested
in his duplication of characteristic phrasing may refer for comparison
<a href="#line-IV-ii-10">ll.&nbsp;13–4</a> to C-G. 299 b; <a href="#line-IV-ii-15">l.&nbsp;17</a> to C-G. 241 a; <a href="#line-IV-ii-20">ll.&nbsp;24–6</a> to
C-G. 547 b; <a href="#line-IV-ii-25">ll.&nbsp;29–30</a> to C-G. 425 b; <a href="#line-IV-ii-55">l.&nbsp;57</a> to C-G. 41 b, 70 b; <a href="#line-IV-ii-90">l.&nbsp;94</a>
to C-G. 182 b. The Scene contains 32 per cent. double endings
and 37 per cent. run-on lines. The authorship of its two songs is
less certain. Field was more given to song-writing than was
Massinger, and the second of this pair is reminiscent in its conception
of the Grace Seldom episode in <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite> (II, i).</p>

<p>The short <a href="#act-IV-iii">IV, iii</a> is by Massinger. In evidence of him are its
36 per cent. of double endings and 55 per cent. of run-on lines, its
involved sentence structure, and the familiar phrasing which
makes itself manifest even in so brief a passage (e.&nbsp;g.: <i>To play
the parasite</i>, <a href="#line-IV-iii-5">l.&nbsp;7</a>—cf. <a href="#line-V-iii-75">V, iii, 78</a> and C-G. 334 b. Cf. also <a href="#line-IV-iii-5">ll.&nbsp;9–10</a>
with D. III, 476; and <a href="#line-IV-iii-20">l.&nbsp;22</a> with C-G. 40 b, 153 a, 262 b.).</p>

<p>The same dramatist’s work continues through the last Scene of
the Act. This, the emotional climax of the play, representing a
quasi-judicial procedure, affords him abundant opportunity for
fervid moralizing and speech-making, of which he takes advantage
most typically. Massinger commonplaces are <a href="#line-IV-iv-25">l.&nbsp;29</a>, <i>Made shipwreck
of your faith</i> (cf. C-G. 55 b, 235 a, 414 b); <a href="#line-IV-iv-55">l.&nbsp;56</a>, <i>In the forbidden
labyrinth of lust</i> (cf. C-G. 298 b); <a href="#line-IV-iv-85">l.&nbsp;89</a>, <i>Angels guard me!</i>
(cf. C-G. 59 b, 475 b); <a href="#line-IV-iv-115">l.&nbsp;118–9</a>, <i>and yield myself Most miserably
guilty</i> (cf. C-G. 61 b, 66 b, 130 a; D. VI, 354); etc.; while within
a year or so of the time when he wrote referring to “those famed
matrons” (<a href="#line-IV-iv-70">l.&nbsp;70</a>), he expatiated upon them in detail (see <cite>The
Virgin Martyr</cite>, C-G. 33 a). Yet more specific parallels may be
found: for <a href="#line-IV-iv-60">l.&nbsp;63</a> cf. C-G. 179 a; <a href="#line-IV-iv-75">ll.&nbsp;76–7</a>, cf. C-G. 28 a; <a href="#line-IV-iv-75">l.&nbsp;78</a>, cf.
C-G. 32 b; <a href="#line-IV-iv-160">ll.&nbsp;162–3</a>, cf. C-G. 3 b, in a passage wherein there is
a certain similarity of situation; <a href="#line-IV-iv-175">l.&nbsp;177</a>, cf. D. IX, 7. Were any
further confirmation needed for Massinger’s authorship, the
metrical tests would supply it, with their 36 per cent. double endings
and 34 per cent. run-on lines.</p>

<p>The most cursory reading of <a href="#act-V-i">V, i</a> is sufficient to establish the
<a id="page-19" href="#page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"> </a>
conviction that its author is not identical with that of the earlier
comic passages—is not Field, but Massinger. The humor, such
as it is, is of a graver, more restrained sort—satiric rather than
burlesque; it has lost lightness and verve, and approaches to
high-comedy and even to moralizing. One feels that the confession
of the tailor-gallant is no mere fun-making devise, but a
caustic attack upon social conditions against which the writer
nurtured a grudge. Massingerian are such expressions as <i>And
now I think on’t better</i> (<a href="#line-V-i-75">l.&nbsp;77</a>—cf. C-G. 57 b, 468 a, 615 a; D. XI,
28), and <i>use a conscience</i> (<a href="#line-V-i-90">l.&nbsp;90</a>—cf. C-G. 444 a, 453 a), while the
metrical evidence of 36 per cent. double endings and 29 per cent.
run-on lines fortifies a case concerning which all commentators
are in agreement. But despite the unanimity of critical opinion
hitherto, I am not sure that Field did not contribute a minor touch
here and there to the Scene. Such contribution, if a fact, must
have been small, for the Massinger flavor is unmistakable
throughout; yet in the <i>Plague on’t!</i> and the <i>’Slid!</i>, in the play
upon words (<a href="#line-V-i-10">ll.&nbsp;13–4</a>, <a href="#line-V-i-20">20–1</a>, <a href="#line-V-i-40">44</a>), which is rare with Massinger
and common with Field, in the line, <i>I only know</i> [<i>thee</i>] <i>now to
hate thee deadly</i>: (cf. <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>, M. 421: <i>I never more
Will hear or see thee, but will hate thee deadly.</i>), we may, perhaps,
detect a hint of his hand.</p>

<p><a href="#act-V-ii">Scene ii</a> (which in the Quarto ends with the reconciliation of
Charalois and Romont, the entry of Du Croy, Charmi, etc. being
marked as the beginning of a third Scene, though the place is
unchanged and the action continuous, wherefore modern editors
disregard the Quarto’s division and count Scene ii as including
all the remainder of the Act) presents the usual distinctive earmarks
of a Massinger passage. The last third of it, however
(<a href="#line-V-ii-80">ll.&nbsp;80–121</a>), has, on account of the presence of several rhymes,
been commonly assigned to Field. No doubt his hand is here
discernable; <a href="#line-V-ii-115">l.&nbsp;118</a>, <i>mark’d me out the way how to defend it</i>, is
scarcely a Massinger construction either; but I cannot think
Field’s presence here more than that of a reviser, just as in the
latter half of <a href="#act-I-ii">I, ii</a>. The language remains more Massinger’s
than Field’s; and while the passage is over-short for metrical
tests to be decisive, the 39 per cent. of double endings and 35
per cent. of run-on lines which it yields (for the earlier part of
the Scene the figures are respectively 28 per cent. and 35 per
<a id="page-20" href="#page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"> </a>
cent.) are corroborative of Massinger’s authorship. Cf. also
<a href="#line-V-ii-95">ll.&nbsp;96–8</a> with this from <cite>The Renegado</cite> (C-G. 157 a):</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-24">This applause</div>
<div class="line">Confirm’d in your allowance, joys me more</div>
<div class="line">Than if a thousand full-cramm’d theatres</div>
<div class="line">Should clap their eager hands.</div>
</div>

<p>Of the final Scene, <a href="#act-V-iii">V, iii</a>, little need be said. It brings before
us again a court-room, with another trial, and continues the
manner of its predecessor, <a href="#act-I-ii">I, ii</a>, as only Massinger can. His
customary formulae, <i>stand bound</i>, <i>play the parasite</i>, etc., are
here; characteristic too are his opposition of <i>wanton heat</i> and
<i>lawful fires</i> (<a href="#line-V-iii-140">ll.&nbsp;141–2</a>—cf. C-G. 37 b; D.&nbsp;V. 476), while further
material for comparison may be found in <a href="#line-V-iii-95">ll.&nbsp;95–6</a> with
<i>Respect</i>, <i>wealth</i>, <i>favour</i>, <i>the whole world for a dower</i> of <cite>The
Virgin Martyr</cite> (C-G. 6 b), and in <a href="#line-V-iii-165">ll.&nbsp;165–7</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<span class="speaker">Char.</span>
<span class="line">You must find other proofs to strengthen these</span><br />
<span class="line">But mere presumptions.</span><br />

<span class="speaker">Du Croy</span>
<span class="line i-10">Or we shall hardly</span><br />
<span class="line">Allow your innocence.</span>
</div>

<p class="continued">with C-G. 39 a and b:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-16">You must produce</div>
<div class="line">Reasons of more validity and weight</div>
<div class="line">To plead in your defence, or we shall hardly</div>
<div class="line">Conclude you innocent.</div>
</div>

<p class="continued">The last passage cited for comparison also exhibits another
feature normal to the work of this dramatist: the splitting of an
observation, frequently a single sentence, between two speakers;
so <a href="#line-V-iii-35">ll.&nbsp;38–9</a>, and again, <a href="#line-V-iii-55">l.&nbsp;59</a>. The Scene and play are rounded
off with the pointing of a moral, so indispensable to Massinger’s
satisfaction.</p>

<p>To sum up, therefore, disregarding for practical purposes the
slight touches of Field in <a href="#line-I-ii-145">I, ii, ll.&nbsp;146–<i>end</i></a>; <a href="#line-III-i-315">III, i, ll.&nbsp;317–343</a>;
<a href="#line-V-ii-80">V, ii, ll.&nbsp;80–<i>end</i></a>; and perhaps in <a href="#act-V-i">V, i</a>;—and the apparent Massinger
touches in <a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i</a>, and possibly at one or two other points
in the Field Scenes, we may divide the play as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="smcap">Massinger:</span> <a href="#act-I">I</a>; <a href="#act-III">III, ll.&nbsp;1–343</a>; <a href="#act-IV">IV</a>, <a href="#act-IV-ii">ii</a>, <a href="#act-IV-iii">iii</a>, <a href="#act-IV-iv">iv</a>; <a href="#act-V">V</a>.</li>
  <li><span class="smcap">Field:</span> <a href="#act-II">II</a>; <a href="#line-III-i-340">III, ll.&nbsp;344–<i>end</i></a>; <a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i.</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a id="page-21" href="#page-21" class="pagenum" title="21"> </a>
A metrical analysis of the play is appended in tabular form, in
which I have computed separately the figures for each portion
of any Scene on which there has been a question. It will be noted
that the single simple test of the mid-line speech-ending would,
with but two exceptions—one (III, i, c) doubtful, and the other
(V, ii, b) too short a passage to afford a fair test—have made a
clean-cut and correct determination of authorship in every case.</p>

<h3 id="critical-estimate">Critical Estimate</h3>

<p>No less an authority than Swinburne has pronounced <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite> the finest tragedy in the Massinger <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i>. Certainly
it would be the most formidable rival of <cite>The Duke of
Milan</cite> for that distinction. It occupies an anomalous position
among the works of the “stage poet.” His dramas are, as a
rule, strongest in construction; he went at play-making like a
skillful architect, and put together and moulded his material with
steady hand. They are likely to be weakest in characterization.
Massinger could not get inside his figures and endow them with
the breath of life; they remain stony shapes chiseled in severely
angular and conventional lines, like some old Egyptian bas-relief.
<a id="page-22" href="#page-22" class="pagenum" title="22"> </a>
But <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> is strong in characterization and
defective in construction.</p>

<p>The structural fault is less surprising when it is ascertained
to be fundamental—inevitable in the theme. The play breaks in
the middle: it is really composed of two stories; the first two
Acts present and resolve one action, while another, hitherto
barely presaged, occupies the last three, and is the proper story
of the Fatal Dowry. Charalois’ self-immolation for the corpse
of his heroic father, and his rescue and reward by the great-hearted
Rochfort, form a little play in themselves—a brief but
stately tragi-comedy, which is followed by a tense drama of
intrigue and retribution, of adultery and avenged honor—itself
complete in itself, for which we are prepared in the first two
Acts only by one figure, whose potentialities for disaster are
ominous if not obvious:—Beaumelle, of whom more later. This
plot-building by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enjambment</i> precludes the slow, steady mounting
of suspense from the initial moment and inexorable gathering
of doom which are manifested in a well-conceived tragedy; yet
crude, amorphous, inorganic as it may seem—defying, as it does,
unity of action—like as it is to the earliest Elizabethan plays,
which were concerned with a single career rather than a single
theme, it would appear inevitably necessary, if a maximum effect
is to be gained from the given plot-material. Just as Wagner
found it impossible to do justice to the story of Siegfried without
first presenting that of Siegmund and Sieglinde, so the experiment
of Rowe (who in re-working the story for <cite>The Fair
Penitent</cite> relegated to expository dialogue the narration of what
corresponds to the first two Acts of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>) sadly
demonstrated that unless the reader or audience actually sees,
and not merely hears about, Charalois’ previous devotion, Rochfort’s
generosity, and Romont’s loyalty, these characters do not
attract to themselves a full measure of sympathy, and the story
of their later vicissitudes is somehow unconvincing and falls flat.</p>

<p>Massinger and Field accepted frankly the structural awkwardness
of their plot as they had fashioned or found it. Making,
apparently, no attempt to obviate its essential duality, they went
to work in the most straightforward manner, and achieved,
thanks in no small measure to that same resolute directness of
approach, a drama of so naturalistic a tone as half to redeem its
<a id="page-23" href="#page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"> </a>
want of unity. <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> is not an Aristotelian tragedy
with a definite beginning, middle, and end—it is rather a cross-section
of life. The unconventionality and vitality of such a
production are startling, and obtain a high degree of verisimilitude.</p>

<p>Both authors seem to have been themselves inspired by their
virile theme to give to it their best work. The stately, somewhat
monotonous verse of Massinger, which never loses dignity and
is so incapable of expressing climaxes of passion, is once or
twice almost forgotten, or else rises to a majesty which transfigures
it. Though forensic declamation was always the especial
forte of this dramatist, he literally out-did himself in his management
of the suit for the dead Marshal’s body. The elaborate
rhetoric of Charmi, checked by the stern harshness of Novall
Senior, the indignant outburst of Romont, and the sad, yet noble
calmness of Charalois’ speech in which he presses the forlorn
alternative, succeed one another with striking contrast; the very
flow of the verse changes with the speaker in a manner which
recalls the wonderful employment of this device by Shakespeare,
as, for example, in the First Act of <cite>Othello</cite>. In the final Scene
of Act IV, Massinger achieves a climax worthy of Fletcher himself;—save,
perhaps, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">denouement</i> of <cite>A New Way to Pay
Old Debts</cite>, and the great scene in <cite>The Duke of Milan</cite> in which
Sforza’s faith in his Duchess is broken down by aspersion after
aspersion, until he slays her, only to learn the terrible truth one
instant later, it is the most dramatic situation he ever worked up.
Field, too, seems to have been on his mettle: his verse is more
trenchant, his care greater than in his two earlier comedies; the
lines (<a href="#line-II-i-125">II, i, 126–7</a>)</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">My root is earthed, and I a desolate branch</div>
<div class="line">Left scattered in the highway of the world,</div>
</div>

<p class="continued">touch the high-water mark of his poetic endeavor.</p>

<p>Blemishes, indeed, are not unapparent. The episodic <a href="#act-V-i">first
Scene of Act V</a> is a rather stupid piece of pseudo-comedy by
Massinger, which serves no function adequate to justify its
existence, while it interrupts the thread of the main story at a
point where its culminating intensity does not, of right, permit
such a diversion. Gifford in commenting upon this Scene makes
<a id="page-24" href="#page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"> </a>
the amazing pronouncement that it serves “to prove how differently
the comic part of this drama would have appeared, if the
whole had fortunately fallen into the hands of Massinger.” Surely
never was criticism more fatuous.</p>

<p>But the most serious—indeed, the outstanding—defect of the
play is the easy readiness of Charalois to break with Romont.
The calm, unregretful placidity with which he untwists the long
web of friendship with a man who has stood by him through
weal and woe, who has courted a prison’s chains for his sake,
shocks us, and repels us with its flinty self-sufficiency. It is not
that we know him to be wrong and Romont to be right; suppose
the high faith of Charalois in Beaumelle to be entirely justified
and the charge of Romont to be as groundless as it is wildly
delivered and unconvincing, yet there is no excuse for the <em>immediacy</em>
with which, on the first revelation of what he himself has
demanded to know, the hero rejects, along with the report of his
friend, the friend himself, whose aim could have been only his
best interest. For the fault lies not in the situation, which is
sound, but in its over-hasty development. A little more length
to the scene, a few more speeches to either participant in the
dialogue, a little longer and more vituperative insistence on the
part of Romont in the face of Charalois’ warnings that he has
gone far enough, and the quarrel would have been thoroughly
realized and developed. As it is, it comes on insufficient provocation;
the hero, at the moment when he should excite regret and
sympathy because of his blind, mistaken trust in his unworthy
wife, excites rather indignation; the later words of Romont with
which he justifies his unshaken loyalty to his comrade turn back
the mind perforce to that comrade’s lack of loyalty to <em>him</em>, and
unwittingly ring out as a judgment upon Charalois:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-8">That friendship’s raised on sand,</div>
<div class="line">Which every sudden gust of discontent,</div>
<div class="line">Or flowing of our passions can change,</div>
<div class="line">As if it ne’er had been:—</div>
</div>

<p class="continued">The faulty passage, it will be noted upon reference to the analysis
of shares in collaboration, is by the hand of Field. Unconvincing
precipitancy in the conduct of situations marks his work elsewhere,
notably in the <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>.</p>

<p><a id="page-25" href="#page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"> </a>
As it has already been said, the strongest feature of the play
is its characterization. Almost every figure is, if not an individual,
at least a type so vitalized as to appear to take on life.
One or two touches, to be sure, of conventional Massingerian
habits of thought still cling about them; even the noblest cannot
entirely forget to consider how their conduct will pose them
before the eyes of the world and posterity. But apart from such
slight occasional lapses, they may truthfully be said to speak and
move quite in the manner of real men and women.</p>

<p>The hero, Charalois, is drawn as of a gentle, meditative, temperate,
and self-possessed disposition, in strong and effective
contrast to his friend. Though his military exploits are spoken
of with admiration, and Romont testifies that he can “pursue a
foe like lightning,” he betrays a certain readiness to yield to discouragement
scarce to be expected in the son of the great general.
In consequence of these facts, he has been described by
some (notably Cunningham, in his Edition of Gifford, Introduction,
p. xiii;—cf. also Phelan, p.&nbsp;61; and Beck, pp.&nbsp;22–3) as
“a Hamlet whose mind has not yet been sicklied o’er by the pale
cast of thought,” and his long silence at the opening of Act I is
compared to that of the Danish Prince on his first appearance.
But, in reality, excess of pride is the chief reason of Charalois’
backwardness on this occasion, and thereafter he acts promptly
and efficiently always. The same over-sensitive pride continues
to manifest itself throughout the play—when he is confronted
with Rochfort’s generosity; when he finds (<a href="#line-III-i-365">III, i, 365</a> ff.) that it
is he who is the object of the jests of Novall Junior and his
satellites (though scarce a breath earlier he has chided Romont
for noticing the yapping of such petty curs); and in the viscissitudes<!--TN: as printed-->
of the catastrophe and its consequences. A harmonious
twin-birth with his pride, at once proceeding from it, bound up
with it, and on occasion over-weighing its scruples, is an extreme
punctiliousness at every turn to the dictates of that peculiarly
Spanish imperative, “the point of honor,”—a consideration so
prominent throughout the play as to have convinced many critics
that the source of the story, although still undiscovered, must
have been Spanish. These two traits—pride and an adherence
to “the point of honor,” are almost invariably the mainsprings
of Charalois’ conduct. His pride holds him back from supplicating
<a id="page-26" href="#page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"> </a>
in behalf of his father the clemency of the unworthy
ministers of the law, till he is persuaded by Romont that honor
not only permits but requires that he do so; he feels that honor
demands that he sacrifice himself to secure his father’s burial, and
he does it; that honor demands that he put away his friend in
loyalty to his wife, and he does it; that honor demands that he
slay the adulteress—and he does it; he even consents to lay bare
the details of his ignominious wrong before the eyes of men,
because he is brought to believe that “the point of honor” calls
for a justification of his course and the holding of it up as an
example to the world. It is a striking and consistent portrait—how
unlike the usual conventionally noble hero of romantic
drama!</p>

<p>Romont, however, is the finest figure of the play. He draws
to himself rather more than his share of interest and sympathy,
to the detriment of the protagonist. Of a type common enough
on the stage of that day—the bluff, loyal soldier-friend of the
hero—he is yet so thoroughly individualized that we can discuss
him and calculate what he will do in given situations, even as
with a character of Shakespeare’s. The portrait suffers from
no jarring inconsistencies; almost his every utterance is absolutely
in part, and adds its touch to round out our conception of
him. His negligence of his personal appearance, his quick temper,
his impulsiveness, his violence, his lack of restraint, his
fierce, uncompromising honesty, his devotion to the “grave General
dead” and his unshaken fidelity to the living son, his flashes
of unexpected tenderness, his homage for the reverend virtue
of Rochfort—a sort of child-like awe for what he knows is finer
if not of truer metal than his own rough spirit, his ill-disguised
scorn for Novall Junior and his creatures, “those dogs in
doublets,” his lack of tact which unfits him for effective service
in the delicate task of preserving Beaumelle’s honor, and dooms
his story to Charalois to disbelief and resentment, his prompt,
fearless decisiveness of action, the tumultuous flood of nervous
and at times eloquent speech which pours from his lips when he
is aroused, yet dies in his throat when he is lashed by a woman’s
tongue—a flood of speech which is most torrential when the
situation is most doubtful or hopeless of good issue, but which
gives place to a self-possessed terseness when he is quite sure of
<a id="page-27" href="#page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"> </a>
his ground:—all go to give detail and reality to a character at
once amazingly alive and irresistibly attractive. “Romont is one
of the noblest of all Massinger’s men,” says Swinburne, “and
Shakespeare has hardly drawn noble men more nobly than Massinger.”
To find a parallel creation who can over-match him in
vigor of presentation and theatrical efficiency, we must go back
to the Melantius of Beaumont and Fletcher. These two characters
represent the ultimate elaborations of the stock figure of the
faithful friend and blunt soldier; Melantius is the supreme
romantic, Romont the supreme realistic, development of the type.</p>

<p>Yet though Romont is the most compelling of the <i>dramatis
personae</i>, into none does Massinger enter more thoroughly than
the noble figure of Rochfort. Utter devotion to virtue, to which
he had paid a life-long fidelity, is the key-note of the nature of
the aged Premier President, and accordingly in him the deep-seated
ethical seriousness of the “stage-poet” found a congenial
expression. A statelier dignity is wont to echo in his lines than
in the utterance of any other character; they breathe an exalted
calm, a graciousness, a grave courtesy, as though the very spirit
of their speaker had entered them.</p>

<p>An inability to judge the character of others was his great
weakness—a weakness which he himself realized, for he called
upon Beaumont to confirm the one strikingly sure, true appraisement
which he exhibited, his admiration for Charalois. Characteristically,
this weakness seems to have taken the form of a
too-generous estimate of his fellows. This caused him to bestow
his vacated office upon the harsh and unjust Novall, and to be
blind to the disposition of his daughter, and the danger that lay
in her intimacy with Novall Junior. But if his kindly nature
saw the better side of even that contemptible young man, he at
least understood him well enough not to take him at all seriously
as a suitor for Beaumelle’s hand.</p>

<p>Of the Novalls, father and son, there is a much briefer presentation.
Yet even so, in the case of old Novall we have as masterly
a sketch as in Romont a detailed study. His every word
is eloquent of his stern, not to say <em>mean</em>, nature—curt and severe
towards others, all prejudice where he himself is concerned, inexorably
malevolent against those who incur his animosity. Yet
it never enters his head to seek the satisfaction of his hate in
<a id="page-28" href="#page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"> </a>
any way save through the law; for example, he does not seize
upon, or even think seriously of, Pontalier’s proffer of private
vengeance; the law is his sphere—he will abuse it to his advantage,
if he can, but he will not go outside of it. He is, in
other words, the Official Bureaucrat <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, and his
enmity against the martial house of the Charaloises and the rigor
with which he is said to “cross every deserved soldier and
scholar,” and, on the other hand, the detestation in which Romont
holds him, are manifestations of the feud of type against
type. It has been suggested that the especial fervor with which
he is devoted to execration argues a prototype in actual life, and
that in him is to be recognized Sir Edward Coke, notorious for
the savage vindictiveness of his conduct towards Sir Walter
Raleigh.</p>

<p>Novall Junior, the cowardly, foppish, and unscrupulous gallant,
though a flimsy personality, affords once or twice, in the
Fieldian prose, rather good humor: e.&nbsp;g.—</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Nay, o’ my soul, ’tis so; what fouler object in the world, than
to see a young, fair, handsome beauty unhandsomely dighted,
and incongruently accoutred? or a hopeful chevalier unmethodically
appointed in the external ornaments of nature? For, even
as the index tells us the contents of stories, and directs to the
particular chapters, even so does the outward habit and superficial
order of garments (in man or woman) give us a taste of
the spirit, and demonstratively point (as it were a manual note
from the margin) all the internal quality and habiliment of the
soul; and there cannot be a more evident, palpable, gross manifestation
of poor, degenerate, dunghilly blood and breeding, than
a rude, unpolished, disordered, and slovenly outside.</i> (<a href="#line-IV-i-45">IV, i,
48–60</a>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the remaining characters, only two call for especial notice.
The three Creditors are a blemish upon the otherwise striking
verisimilitude of the play; they are impossible, inhuman monsters
of greed and relentlessness, who serve as vehicles for a kind of
grotesque comedy. A personal rancour on the part of the authors
may have been responsible for this presentation, as it is probable
that they themselves had had none-too-pleasant experiences with
money-lenders. Pontalier, however, is very well conceived and
skillfully executed. Occupying a relation to Novall Junior quite
<a id="page-29" href="#page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"> </a>
similar to that of Romont to Charalois, he is yet differentiated
from his parallel, while at the same time he is kept free from any
taint of the despicableness and fawning servility which are
chiefly prominent in the parasites of the vicious and feather-brained
young lord. There is something really pathetic about
this brave, honorable soldier, committed to the defense of an
unworthy benefactor, ranged on the side of wrong against right,
by his very best qualities: his noble sense of gratitude, his loyalty,
his devotion to what he conceives to be his duty. It will be observed
that he never joins with the rest of the group about
Novall Junior in their jibes against Charalois and Romont.</p>

<p>The last figure for consideration, and not the least important,
is Beaumelle. So general has been the misconception of her
character that it calls for a more detailed analysis than has been
accorded to the other personages of the drama, or than the place
she occupies might appear to warrant. That place, indeed, is not
a striking one; she is scarce more than a character of second
rank, appearing in but few scenes and speaking not many lines.
Yet her part in the story is one of such potentialities that in
Rowe’s version of the same theme her analogue becomes the
central figure, and even in <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> a failure to understand
her has probably been at the bottom of most of the less
favorable judgments that have been passed upon the play, while
those critics who appraise it higher yet acknowledge her to be its
one outstanding defect. “<cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>,” says Saintsbury
(<cite>Hist. Eng. Lit.</cite>, vol. ii, p.&nbsp;400) “... is ... injured by the unattractive
character of the light-of-love Beaumelle before her
repentance (Massinger never could draw a woman).” She is
declared by Swinburne to be “too thinly and feebly drawn to
attract even the conventional and theatrical sympathy which
Fletcher might have excited for a frail and penitent heroine: and
the almost farcical insignificance and baseness of her paramour
would suffice to degrade his not involuntary victim beneath the
level of any serious interest or pity.” If these and similar pronouncements
were well founded, the play as a cross-section of
life would have the great weakness of being unconvincing at a very
vital point. A study of the text, however, will discover Beaumelle
to be portrayed, in the brief compass of her appearance,
in no wise inadequately, but rather, if anything, somewhat beyond
<a id="page-30" href="#page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"> </a>
the requirements of her dramatic function—will reveal her, not,
indeed, a personage of heroic proportions and qualities, but a
young woman of considerable naturalness, plausibility, and realistic
convincingness.</p>

<p>The trouble has probably been that the critics of Beaumelle
have passed hastily over the very scurrilous prose scene in which
she first appears. They have looked on this passage as merely a
piece of Fieldian low-comedy, a coarse bit of buffoonery which
pretends to no function save that of humor, and can sustain not
even this pretense. Nothing can be further from the truth. The
passage <em>is</em> a piece of coarse comedy such as Field had an over-fondness
for writing; but it is something more; in reality, a
proper understanding of the heroine is conditioned upon it.</p>

<p>Beaumelle is a young girl whose mother, we may infer, has
long been dead. The cares of the bench have been too great to
allow her father time for much personal supervision of her; she
has had for associates her two maids, and of these she not unnaturally
finds the gay and witty, but thoroughly depraved, Bellapert
the more congenial, and adopts her as her mentor and confidant.
She is in love, after a fashion—caught, like the impressionable,
uncritical girl she is, by the fair exterior of a young
magnificent, whose elegant dress and courtly show of devotion
quite blind her to his real worthlessness—and there is scant likelihood
of her getting the man who has charmed her fancy. Her
disposition is high-spirited and wayward, but not deliberately
vicious; she has certain hazily defined ideals, mingled with the
same romantic mist through which the superfine dandy, Novall,
appears in her eyes a very Prince Charming: she “would meet
love and marriage both at once”; she desires to preserve her
honor. She has ideals, but she doubts their tangibility; she is in
an unsettled state of mind, questioning the fundamentals of conduct
and social relationships, in much need of good counsel. In
that perilous mood she talks with Bellapert—Bellapert, the dearest
cabinet of her secrets—Bellapert, the bribed instrument of Novall—and
is told by that worldly-wise wench that marriage almost
never unites with love, but must be used as a cloak for it; that
honor is a foolish fancy; that a husband is a master to be outwitted
and despised. The shaft sinks home all too surely; a
<a id="page-31" href="#page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"> </a>
visit at that very moment by Beaumelle’s lover completes the
conquest, when her father interrupts their tete-a-tete—her father,
who comes with the anouncement that she must marry a man
whom she does not even know! In the scene where the destined
bride and groom are brought face to face, she stands throughout
in stony silence quite as eloquent as the more famous speechlessness
of Charalois at the beginning of the play. She has ever been
“handmaid” to her father’s will; she realizes all her hopes and
fortunes “have reference to his liking;” and now she obeys,
with the bitter thought in her heart that Fate, in denying her her
will, has wronged Love itself (<a href="#line-II-ii-150">II, ii, 154</a>); only when Charalois
turns to her with a direct question, “Fair Beaumelle, can you love
me?” does she utter a word—then from her lips a brief, desperate,
“Yes, my lord”—and a moment later (<a href="#line-II-ii-315">II, ii, 315</a>) she is weeping
silently. (Her answer was honest in as far as she really did
mean to give to the man chosen for her husband her duty with
her hand.) Then the voice of the tempter whispers in her ear,
she feels its tug at her heart, and with a cry, “Oh, servant!—Virtue
strengthen me!” she hurries from the room. That is the
situation at the end of the Second Act and first part of the play;
an appreciation of its significance makes the connection with
what follows less arbitrary and inorganic.</p>

<p>When Beaumelle next appears, in the Third Act, there has
been a change. We may imagine that she has had time to ponder
those cynical maxims of Bellapert on the natural course of
romance. Her union has been unwilling; she does not care for
her husband; Novall appeals to her as much as ever: with her
eyes open, she deliberately chooses the path of sin—because the
enforced marriage which shattered her hopes must needs appear
to her the final demonstration of the correctness of her maid’s
contention (towards which she was already inclining) that she
has been foolishly impractical to dream of the satisfaction of her
heart’s wish through wedlock, but that it is by secret amour that
love must be, and is wont to be, enjoyed.</p>

<p>It may not be unreasonable to regard the resourcefulness and
effrontery which characterize her throughout the Third Act as
the result of a sort of mental intoxication, into which she has
been lifted by her reckless resolve and the consciousness of
danger; at any rate she now shows herself altogether too much
<a id="page-32" href="#page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"> </a>
for Romont; she finds a shrewdness and an eloquence that carry
her triumphant to the consummation of her desire. When discovery
ensues, her paramour is slain, and she herself is haled to
die, she is overcome—abruptly and, one might say, strangely—with
remorse and penitence. But it is not at all by one of those
theatrically convenient but psychologically absurd changes of
heart so frequent in the drama of that period; nothing, indeed,
could be more true to life. Novall Junior, coward and fop that
he was, has hitherto always borne himself in lordly fashion before
her, even when they were surprised by Romont; but now at last
she beholds him stripped to the shivering abjectness of his contemptible
soul, that she may observe his baseness. She sees him
cowed and beaten and slain, while Charalois (whom she never
knew before their marriage nor has tried to understand in the
brief period of their wedlock) with his outraged honor and irresistible
prowess assumes to her eyes the proportions of a hero;
and with her girl’s romanticism<a id="marker-10" href="#footnote-10" class="marker" title="Footnote 10">10</a> of nature, she bows down and
worships him. It is somewhat the same note that is struck by
Thackeray in the similar situation where Rawdon Crawley, returning
home unexpectedly, finds his wife with Lord Steyne and
knocks the man down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>It was all done before Rebecca could interpose. She stood
there trembling before him. She admired her husband, strong,
brave, victorious.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it was with Beaumelle. Except for one brief cry of “Undone
for ever!” she utters no word from the moment of the surprise
to the end of the Scene. She hangs back, shrinking, for a
moment, when ordered into the coach with the dead body of her
partner in guilt. “Come,” says Charalois, in terrible jest, “you
have taught me to say, you must and shall.... You are but to
keep him company you love—” and she obeys mutely.</p>

<p>Thus, all contriteness, Beaumelle goes to her fate. It should
be observed how, even at the last, her tendency to romantic idealization
vehemently asserts itself; she looks fondly back (<a href="#line-IV-iv-50">IV, iv, 53</a>)
<a id="page-33" href="#page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"> </a>
to an imagined time, which never really existed, when she
was “good” and “a part of” Charalois, made one with him
through the virtuous harmony of their minds!—no voice is more
unfaltering than her own to pronounce her doom as both righteous
and necessary, and she conceives herself to climb, by her ecstatic
welcoming of death, into the company of the ancient heroines and
martyrs. In its realism of the commonplace and its slightly ironic
conception, it is the outline drawing of a character that might
have received elaborate portraiture at the hands of Flaubert.</p>

<p>Whether we are to regard this consistent “study in little” as a
deliberate piece of work on the part of the authors, must remain
a matter of opinion. There is no similar figure elsewhere in the
dramatic output of Massinger, nor any quite so minutely conceived
within the same number of speech-lines in that of Field,
and one could scarce be blamed for believing that a number of
hap-hazard, sketchy strokes with which the collaborators dashed
off a character whom they deemed of no great importance, all so
fell upon the canvas that, by a miracle of chance, they went to
form the lineaments of a real woman. The discussion of the
probability or possibility of such a hypothesis would carry us
very far afield, and would involve the question of the extent to
which all genius is unconscious and intuitive. But however that
may be, the <em>result</em> of their labors remains the same, there to
behold in black and white, and Beaumelle, so far from being a
poorly conceived and unsatisfactory wanton who is the chief
defect of the play, is a figure of no mean verisimilitude who succeeds
after a fashion in linking together the loose-knit dual structure
of the drama; to whose main catastrophe she adds her own
tragedy, a tragedy neither impressive nor deeply stirring, it is
true, for she is a petty spirit from whom great tragedy does not
proceed—but tragedy still—the eternal, inevitable tragedy of false
romanticism, that has found its culmination in the person of
Emma Bovary.</p>

<p>In this study of Beaumelle, <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> has been subjected
to a much more intensive examination than it is the custom
to bestow upon the dramas of the successors of Shakespeare.
The truth is that the plays of the Jacobean period do not, as a
rule, admit of such analysis. In most of them, and especially in
the plays of Massinger, he who searches and probes them comes
<a id="page-34" href="#page-34" class="pagenum" title="34"> </a>
presently to a point beyond which critical inquiry is stopped short
with a desperate finality; be they ever so strikingly splendid and
glittering fair in their poetry and their characterization, these
dazzling qualities lie upon the surface, and a few careful perusals
exhaust their possibilities and tell us all there is to know of them.
But <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>, though less imposing than a number of
others, stands almost alone among its contemporaries in sharing
with the great creations of Shakespeare the power to open new
vistas, to present new aspects, to offer new suggestions, the longer
it is studied. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, as has already
been said, it is not so much a tragedy of the accepted type as a
cross-section of life.</p>

<p>How does it come about, we may well ask, that this play possesses
qualities so rare and so strangely at variance with those
which are normal to the work of Massinger—its masterly portrait-gallery
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</i> and its inexhaustible field for
interpretation. We can suspect an answer only in the complementary
nature of the two minds that went to fashion it—in the
union in this one production of the talents of Massinger and of
Field.</p>

<p>A reference to the analysis of collaboration discloses that, so
far as the actual writing of the play goes, the figure of Novall
Senior is altogether the work of Massinger. His son, on the
other hand, is almost entirely the work of Field; in Massinger’s
share he appears only in the first part of <a href="#act-III-i">III, i</a>, and in the scene
of his surprisal and death. Indeed, both the young gallant himself
and all his satellites can safely be put down as creations of the
actor-dramatist. They have their parallels in his comedy of
<cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite>, down to the page whose pert <i>asides</i>
of satiric comment are anticipated in the earlier work by those of
a youngster of identical kidney. The long scene in which we are
introduced to Beaumelle and given insight into her character and
mental attitude is Field’s throughout; thereafter she has only to
act out her already-revealed nature—first as the impudent adulteress
and later as the repentant<!--TN: was 'repentent'--> sinner, in both of which roles she
affords Massinger excellent opportunities to display his favorite
powers of speech-making. Charalois, Romont, and Rochfort are
treated at length by both dramatists.</p>

<p>But in a harmonious collaboration, such as <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>
<a id="page-35" href="#page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"> </a>
plainly was, the contributions of the two authors cannot be identified
with the passages from their respective pens. Each must
inevitably have planned, suggested, criticised. The question remains
whether we can in any measure determine what part of the
conception was due to each. Beyond the Novall Junior group
we cannot establish distinct lines of cleavage. What we can do
is to suggest the features of the finished product which Field and
Massinger brought severally to its making—to point out the qualities
of the two men which were joined to produce the play they
have given us.</p>

<p>The outstanding excellences of Massinger were a thorough
grasp of the architectonics of play-making in the building both of
separate Act and entire drama; an adherence to an essential unity
of design and treatment; a conscientious regard to the details of
stage-craft; a vehicle of dignified and at times noble verse, without
violent conceits or lapses into triviality, sustained, lucid, regular;
and a genuine eloquence in forensic passages. His chief
weaknesses were a certain stiffness of execution which made his
plays appear always as structures rather than organisms, a ponderous
monotony of fancy, and an inability to create or reproduce
or understand human nature. His characters are normally
types, their qualities—honor, virtue, bravery, etc.—mere properties
which they can assume or lay aside at pleasure like garments,
their conduct governed more by the exigencies of plot
than by any conceivable psychology.</p>

<p>The weaknesses of Field—as revealed in his two independent
comedies—were of a nature more evasive, less capable of definition.
A tendency to weave too many threads into the action, an
occasional hasty and skimping treatment of his scenes which
leaves them unconvincing for lack of sufficient elaboration, and
a general thinness of design and workmanship are discoverable.
Defects such as these could be readily corrected by association
with the single-minded, painstaking, thorough Massinger. On
the other hand he possessed a lightness of touch, a blithe vigor,
and a racy, though often obscene, humor foreign to his colleague.
What is more important, he possessed a considerable first-hand
knowledge of men and women, and an ability to put them in his
plays and endow them with something of life—not to conceive
great figures, such as dominate the imagination, but to reproduce
<a id="page-36" href="#page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"> </a>
with vitality and freshness the sort of people he saw about him—in
other words, not to create but to depict; and furthermore Field
seems to have had a special gift for sketching them rather clearly
in a very brief compass.<a id="marker-11" href="#footnote-11" class="marker" title="Footnote 11">11</a> Mr. Saintsbury was right in declaring
that Massinger never could draw a woman. But Field could,
and the critic was rather unfortunate in applying his broadly
correct observation to the one woman of Massinger’s in the
delineation of whom he had Field to help him!</p>

<p>With these facts in mind, the distinctive virtues of <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite> can be accounted for. Massinger here possessed a
colleague who had just those talents of insight and verve and
grasp of life that were denied his own plodding, bookishly
learned mind. Not only young Novall and his satellites, but
Beaumelle certainly, and probably Pontalier (whom Massinger
would have been more likely to degrade to the baseness of Novall’s
other dependents) may be put down as essentially Field’s
creations, while in the case of the others he was ever at Massinger’s
elbow to guard him against blunders, if, indeed, their
preliminary mapping out of the rather obvious lines along which
the action and characters must develop were not of itself a sufficiently
sure guide. To Massinger, on the other hand, may safely
be ascribed the basic conception of such stately figures as Charalois
and Rochfort, however much Field may have been responsible
for preserving them as fresh and living portraits.</p>

<p>As to share in plot structure, in the absence of any known
source, we may conjecture that the germ from which the play
evolved was the conception of that situation by which Charalois,
burdened as he is with an immense debt of thankfulness to Rochfort,
finds himself suddenly called by the imperative demands of
<a id="page-37" href="#page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"> </a>
honor to do that which will strike his benefactor to the heart.
The grounding of the hero’s debt of gratitude in the story of Miltiades
and Cimon was probably the work of Massinger, of whose
veneration for things classic we have abundant evidence, while
to him also, we may believe, was due the shaping of the story in
such fashion that he had opportunity to exploit his greatest gift
in no less than two formal trials, one informal trial, and a long
Act besides given over almost exclusively to verbose disputes
and exhortations. The circumstances of the discovery of the
amour of Beaumelle and Novall, while penned by Massinger, are
more likely an invention of Field’s, not only as faintly reminiscent
of his <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>, but as according better with the
general spirit of his work.</p>

<p>Several plays of the Massinger <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus</i> are more striking on
first acquaintance than <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>, and yet others surpass
it in regard to this feature or that. It has not the gigantic protagonist
of <cite>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</cite>, or the admirable
structure of that fine play, which works with ever-cumulating
intensity to one final, tremendous climax. It has not the impressiveness
of <cite>The Duke of Milan</cite>, or its sheer sweep of tragic
passion and breathless intensity, or anything so compelling as its
great scene of gathering jealousy that breaks forth at last in
murder. Its verse is less poetic than that of <cite>The Maid of Honor</cite>;
it lacks the charm of <cite>The Great Duke of Florence</cite>, and the ethical
fervor of <cite>The Roman Actor</cite>. But in utter reality, in convincing
simulation of life, which holds good under the most exhaustive
study and makes that study forever continue to yield new suggestions
and new appreciations, and in abundance and inherent
truthfulness of detailed characterization, it stands alone, and
these sterling qualities must so outweigh its defects as to insure
for it a high place, not only among the productions of its authors,
but among the plays of the Jacobean Period as a whole.</p>


<h3 id="stage-history">Stage History—Adaptations—Derivatives</h3>

<p>Beyond the statement on the title-page of the 1632 Quarto,
that <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> had been “often acted at the Private House
in Blackfriars by his Majesties Servants,” nothing is known of
its early stage history. It was not revived after the Restoration,
<a id="page-38" href="#page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"> </a>
and until the publication of the Coxeter edition of Massinger
seems to have been almost unknown. At last, in 1825, an
emended version was placed upon the boards by no less an actor
than the great Macready. January 5 of that year was the date,
and Drury Lane the place, of its initial performance, Macready
himself taking the part of Romont, Wallack—Charalois, Terry—Rochfort,
and Mrs. W. West—Beaumelle. “The play was well
acted and enthusiastically applauded,” says Macready in his
<cite>Reminiscences</cite> (p.&nbsp;228); “its repetition for the following Tuesday
was hailed most rapturously; but Friday<a id="marker-12" href="#footnote-12" class="marker" title="Footnote 12">12</a> came, and with it
a crowded house, to find me laboring under such indisposition
that it was with difficulty I could keep erect without support.”
Macready’s serious illness cut short the run of the play, and when
he was at length (April 11) able to take it up again, the interest
of the public had abated, and it in consequence was repeated only
a few times—seven being the total number of its performances.</p>

<p>The variant of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> in which Macready acted was
the work of Sheil, and involved substantial divergences. Romont’s
release from prison follows immediately upon Novall
Senior’s consent to his pardon, and in consequence, together with
his conversation with Rochfort, is transferred from Act II to the
close of Act I, while the redemption of Charalois takes place at
the funeral of his father, which concludes Act II. For the scene
between Beaumelle and her maids is substituted another coloquy
of similar import but chastened tone. A brief scene of no especial
significance is inserted at the beginning of Act III, in the interval
between which and the preceding Act three weeks are supposed
to have elapsed; the rest of Act III follows much the same course
as the original, save that the application of Romont to Rochfort
and his foiling by the stratagem of Beaumelle and Bellapert are
omitted. A really notable departure is found in the discovery
of the amour by Charalois. According to Sheil, Novall Junior
and his mistress attempt to elope, but the note which appoints
their rendezvous falls into Charalois’ hands, and he waits for the
lovers and surprises them, killing Novall off-stage. The Fifth
Act opens with a scene of a few lines only, in which Beaumont
bears to Rochfort a request from Charalois to meet him in the
church yard. Then follows a lugubrious scene in the dead of
<a id="page-39" href="#page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"> </a>
night beside the tomb of the hero’s father, to which place are
transferred the reconciliation between Charalois and Romont,
and the judgment of Rochfort! Beaumelle, however, does not
appear during the trial, and upon the paternal sentence of doom,
Charalois reveals her body, slain already by his hand. To the
father he vindicates his action in much the same words as in
Massinger’s last court-room scene, and then, on the appearance
of Novall Senior clamoring for vengeance and accompanied by
the minions of the law, stabs himself.</p>

<p>The version of Sheil follows with but occasional exceptions
the language of the original wherever possible. It makes some
slight changes in the minor characters.</p>

<p>Sheil’s redaction was also presented at Bath on February 18
and 21, Romont being acted by Hamblin, Charalois by Warde,
Beaumelle by Miss E. Tree. “Hamblin never appeared to so
much advantage—in the scene with Novall he reminded one
strongly of John Kemble,” says Genest (<cite>Hist. Dra. and Stage in
Eng.</cite>, IX, 322).</p>

<p>At Sadler’s Wells, Samuel Phelps, who at that time was reviving
a number of the old dramas, took the stage in <cite>The Fatal
Dowry</cite> on August 27, 1845. This, however, was Sheil’s version,
and not the original play of Massinger and Field, as has been
sometimes supposed. It ranked as one of his four chief productions
of that year. He, too, chose for himself the part of
Romont, which was considered by many his greatest quasi-tragic
role. Marston appeared as Charalois, G. Bennett as Rochfort,
and Miss Cooper as Beaumelle.</p>

<p><cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> in substantially its own proper form does
not appear ever to have been acted after Jacobean times.</p>

<hr class="break" />

<p>If the stage career of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> has been meagre, not
so the extent of its influence. Its literary parenthood begins before
“the closing of the theatres” and continues even to our own
day. As early as 1638 it was echoed in <cite>The Lady’s Trial</cite> of
Ford. Here the figures of Auria, Adurni, Aurelio, and Spinella
correspond roughly with Charalois, young Novall, Romont, and
Beaumelle respectively. Auria has gone to the wars, and in his
absence his wife is pursued by Adurni, who sits at table with her
in private, when Aurelio breaks in upon them, bursting open the
<a id="page-40" href="#page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"> </a>
doors. Spinella bitterly resents the intrusion and the aspersions
of the intruder, and when, on the return home of Auria, Aurelio
accuses her to him, it is without shaking his faith in her loyalty.
Here the analogy ends: spite of Auria’s incredulousness there is
no rupture between the friends; Spinella establishes her innocence;
and Adurni, while guilty enough in his intent against her,
shows himself thereafter to be an essentially noble youth, who
will defend to any length the lady’s honor which has become
subject to question through fault of his, and for this gallant
reparation, is not only forgiven, but even cherished ever after by
the husband he had sought to wrong.</p>

<p>The more steadily one regards the man John Ford and his
work, the more probable does it appear that the relationship between
<cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> and <cite>The Lady’s Trial</cite> is not one of mere
reminiscence or influence, but of direct parentage. That strange
and baleful figure, who seems almost a modern Decadent born
out of his time, had a profound interest in moral problems, to the
study of which he brought morbid ethical sensibilities scarce
matched before the latter nineteenth century. (Witness his conception,
in <cite>The Broken Heart</cite>, of a loveless marriage as tantamount
to adultery.) Ford’s talent for invention was deficient to
the extent that he was hard put to it for plots. It is not at all
unlikely that he surveyed the Massingerian tragedy, and, repelled
by the conduct of its figures, exclaimed to himself: “I will write
a play to centre around a situation as incriminating as that of Act
III of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>; but my personages will be worthier
characters; I will show a lady who, spite of appearances, is of
stainless innocence and vindicates her husband’s trust in the face
of evidence; I will show a friendship strong enough to endure an
honestly mistaken aspersion put upon the chastity of a wife,
though the charge is not for one moment credited; I will show
that even the would-be seducer may be a fine fellow at bottom,
and set forth a generous emulation in magnanimity between him
and the husband. See how finely everything would work out
with the <em>right</em> sort of people!” It is at least a plausible hypothesis.</p>

<p>Nicholas Rowe, who was the first modern editor of Shakespeare,
contemplated also an edition of Massinger, but gave up
the project that he might more safely plunder one of his plays.
<a id="page-41" href="#page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"> </a>
Rowe’s famous tragedy, <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite>, was deliberately
stolen from <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>. It appeared in 1703, and spite
of a ludicrous accident<a id="marker-13" href="#footnote-13" class="marker" title="Footnote 13">13</a> which cut short its first run, took rank
as one of the most celebrated dramas of the English stage. Rowe
lived during the vogue of the “She-tragedy,” while the canons
of literary criticism of his day demanded a “regular,” pseudo-classical
form and a sententious tone. Accordingly, in his hands
the chief figure in the play, as is evidenced by the change in title,
becomes the guilty wife, here called Calista, who is “now the
evil queen of the heroic plays; now the lachrymose moralizer;”
the theme is indeed <em>her</em> story, not Altamont’s (Charalois)—her
seduction (prior to the nuptuals<!--TN: as printed--> and before the opening of the
play), her grief, her plight, her exposure, her death;—she holds
the centre of the stage to the very end. The number of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personae</i> is cut down to eight; all touches of comedy
are excised; and the double plot of the original is unified by the
bold stroke of throwing back to a time before the opening of the
play the entire episode of the unburied corpse and the origin of
the hero’s friendship with the father of the heroine.</p>

<p>Discussions of the relative merits of <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite> and its
source have been almost invariably acrimonious. Nor is this to
be wondered at, for after reading the old tragedy with its severe
dignity and noble restraint, one can scarce peruse without irritation
the cloyingly melifluous<!--TN: as printed-->, emasculated verse of Rowe—by
<a id="page-42" href="#page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"> </a>
turns grandiloquent and sentimental. The characterization of
<cite>The Fair Penitent</cite> is, in the main, insipid, and while Rowe’s
heroine holds a commanding place in her drama to which Beaumelle
does not pretend, the latter is a great deal more natural,
and indeed, for that matter, far more truly a “penitent.” An exception
to the general insipidity is Lothario, who is the analogue
of the insignificant Novall Junior—“the gay Lothario”—whose
very name has been ever since a synonym for the graceful, graceless,
devil-may-care libertine—whose figure has been the prototype
of a long line of similar characters in English literature,
beginning with Richardson’s Lovelace and not yet closed with
Anthony Hope’s Rupert of Hentzau. Beside this striking creation,
the seducer of Beaumelle shows poorly indeed; but it is
doubtful if the old dramatists would have consented to paint
such an attractive rogue, had they been able; they wanted their
Novall to be just the cowardly, dandyfied thing they made him.
Beyond the portrait of Lothario, small ground for praise can be
found in <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite>. That part of the action of <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite> which under Rowe’s treatment antedates the rise
of the curtain is narrated in the most stiffly mechanical sort of
exposition; the action is developed by such threadbare theatrical
devices as a lost letter and an overheard conversation; the voluble
speeches of the several characters are, throughout, declamatory
effusions almost unbelievably divorced from the apposite utterance
of any rational human being under the circumstances. An
Altamont who has been assured and reassured from his bride’s
own lips of her aversion for him can fling himself from a quarrel
with his life-long friend in hysterical defence of her, to seek
solace in her arms—</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">There if in any pause of love I rest</div>
<div class="line">Breathless with bliss upon her panting breast,</div>
<div class="line">In broken, melting accents I will swear,</div>
<div class="line">Henceforth to trust my heart with none save her;</div>
</div>

<p class="continued">a Sciolto who has given his daughter a dagger with which to end
her shame, and then has arrested her willing arm with the prayer
that she will not dispatch herself until he is gone from the sight
of her, can thereupon take leave of her with the statement:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">There is I know not what of sad presage</div>
<div class="line">That tells me I shall never see thee more.</div>
</div>

<p class="continued"><a id="page-43" href="#page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"> </a>
The play, which enjoyed an immense fame, high contemporary
appreciation, and a long career on the stage, remains a curious
memorial of the taste of a bygone day.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite> Horatio, as Romont
in all modern reproductions of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>, is the great
acting part—not the husband.</p>

<p>In 1758 was produced at the Hay market a drama entitled <cite>The
Insolvent or Filial Piety</cite>, from the pen of Aaron Hill. In the
preface it is said—according to Genest (IV, 538)—“Wilks about
30 years before gave an old manuscript play, called the <cite>Guiltless
Adulteress</cite>, to Theo. Cibber who was manager of what then was
the Summer Company—after an interval of several years this
play was judged to want a revisal to fit it for representation—Aaron
Hill at the request of Theo. Cibber almost new wrote the
whole, and the last act was entirely his in conduct, sentiment and
diction.” In reality, <cite>The Insolvent</cite> is <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> over
again, altered to tragicomedy, and with the names of the characters
changed. The first two Acts of Hill’s play proceed much
after the manner of its prototype, with close parallels in language.
From thenceforward, however, the action diverges. The bride,
Amelia, resists the further attentions of her former sweetheart.
They are none the less observed and suspected by her husband’s
friend, who speaks of the matter to both her father and her lord.
The former promises to observe her with watchful eye; Chalons,
the husband, is at first resentful of the imputation, but presently
yields to his friend’s advice, that he pretend a two-days’ journey,
from which he will return unexpectedly. During his absence,
his wife’s maid introduces the lover into her mistress’ chamber
while Amelia sleeps. There Chalons surprises him kneeling beside
the bed, and kills him. Amelia stabs herself, but the confession
of her maid reveals her innocence, and her wound is
pronounced not mortal.</p>

<p>It has been suggested (<cite>Biographia Dramatica</cite>, II, 228—quoted
by Phelan, p.&nbsp;59, and Schwarz, p.&nbsp;74) that in Hill’s <cite>Zara</cite> (adaptation
of the <cite>Zaire</cite> of Voltaire), also, Nerestan’s voluntary return
to captivity in order to end that of his friends, whom he lacked
the means to ransom with gold, was suggested by the behavior
of Charalois; but this can be no more than a coincidence, as it
here but reproduces what is in the French original.</p>

<p><a id="page-44" href="#page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"> </a>
A long interval, and finally, in the dawn of the twentieth century,
there appeared the next and latest recrudescence of <cite>The
Fatal Dowry</cite>. This was <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Graf von Charolais, ein Trauerspiel</cite>,
by Richard Beer-Hofmann, disciple of the Neo-Romantic School
or <i>Vienna Decadents</i>, a coterie built about the leadership of Hugo
von Hofmannsthal. Beer-Hofmann’s play—a five-Act tragedy
in blank verse—was produced for the first time at the Neue
Theatre, Berlin, on December 24, 1904, and was received with
considerable acclaim. Unlike Rowe, he gives full credit to his
source, from which he has drawn no less extensively than the
author of <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite>. Unlike Rowe, he goes back to the
old dramatists in the matter of construction, placing upon the
stage once more the episode of the unburied corpse and the noble
son; he even outdoes <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> in this respect, by allowing
the first half of his plot three Acts instead of two, with only
two Acts for the amour and its tragic consequences. In his hands
the hero again becomes the central figure; in fact, the three principal
versions of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donnee</i> suggest by their titles their respective
viewpoints: <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>; <cite>The Fair Penitent</cite>; <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Graf von
Charolais</cite>. DER GRAF VON CHAROLAIS, be it observed;—this
new redaction is no longer the tale of a “fatal dowry;”
no longer is the first part of the dual theme merely introductory
and accessory—it is coördinate with the second. Beer-Hofmann
has sought to achieve a kind of unity from his double plot by
making his fundamental theme not the adulterous intrigue, but
<em>the destiny of Charolais</em>, thus converting the play into a Tragedy
of Fate, which pursues the hero inexorably through all his life.
This strictly classical <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">motif</i> animating the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">donnee</i> of a Jacobean
play reproduced in the twentieth century presents, as might be expected,
the aspect of an exotic growth, which is not lessened by
the extreme sensuousness of treatment throughout, such as has
always been one of the cardinal and distinctive qualities of the
Decadent School the world over. But as a contrast in the dramatic
technique and verse of Jacobean and modern times, <cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der
Graf von Charolais</cite> is extremely interesting. The difference is
striking between the severe simplicity of three centuries ago, and
the elaborate stagecraft of to-day, its insistence on detail, and
studied care in the portraiture of minor characters. Yet minutia
do not make tragedy, and while their superficial realism and the
<a id="page-45" href="#page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"> </a>
congeniality of the contemporary point of view undeniably lend
to Beer-Hofmann’s redaction a palatability and a power to interest
and appeal which its original does not possess to the
modern reader, yet a discriminating critic will turn back to the
old play with a feeling that, for all its stiffness and conventions,
he breathes there a more vital air. To the enrichment of his
theme Beer-Hofmann contributes every ingenious effect possible
to symbolism, delicate suggestion, and scenic device; this exterior
decoration is gorgeous in its color and seductive warmth, but no
amount of such stuff can compensate for the fundamental flaw
in the crucial episode of his tragedy. In spite of the care which
he has lavished on the scene between his heroine and her seducer,
the surrender of the wife—three years married, a mother, and
loving both husband and child—remains insufficiently motivated
and sheerly inexplicable, and by this vital, inherent defect the
play must fall. Moreover, it lacks a hero. Romont can no
longer play the main part he did in former versions; he is reduced
to a mere shadow. In a tragedy of Fate, which blights a
man’s career, phase by phase, with persistent, relentless hand,
that man must necessarily be the central figure, and, of right,
<em>should</em> be an imposing figure—a protagonist at once gigantic and
appealing, who will draw all hearts to him in pity and terror at
the helpless, hopeless struggle of over-matched greatness and
worth; whereas Charolais—</p>

<p>The case of Charolais is peculiar. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</i> we should expect
him to be just such a personage, yet his conduct throughout is
best explainable as that of a man dominated, not by noble impulses,
but by an extreme egoism—a man acutely responsive
alike to his sense-impressions and his feverish imagination, and
possessed of an exaggerated squeamishness towards the ugly and
the unpleasant. When, in the First Act, he bursts into tears, he
confesses it is not for his father that he weeps, but for his own
hard lot; he suffers from his repugnance to the idea of his
father’s corpse rotting above ground—a repugnance so intolerable
to him that he will yield his liberty to escape it. He purposes
to cashier the innkeeper because the sight of the lecherous
patrons of his hostelry has disgusted him, and he alters his resolve
and forgives the fellow, not from any considerations of
mercy, but because the mental picture of the man’s distress tortures
<a id="page-46" href="#page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"> </a>
him. And by similar personal repugnances reacting on
egoism is his behavior in the denouement to be accounted for, and
in this light becomes logically credible and clearly understood.
Few practices are more hazardous or unjust than judging an
artist by his objective creations; but an ignoble protagonist, as
Charolais is represented, is in such ill accord with any conceivable
purpose on the part of Beer-Hofmann, and so unlikely to have
been intended by him, that one cannot help strongly suspecting
that the author unconsciously projected himself into the character
and thus revealed his own nature and point of view. In
any case he has presented for his hero a whimperer who can command
neither our sympathy nor our respect when he cries above
the bodies of his benefactor and her who is that benefactor’s
daughter, his own wife, and the mother of his child:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line">Ist dies Stück denn aus,</div>
<div class="line">Weil jene starb? Und ich? An mich denkt keiner?</div>
</div>

<p>We have come a long way from Massinger and Field and the
early seventeenth century. The shadow of the old dramatists
reaches far, even to our own time; we have seen their play redeveloped,
but never improved upon, by pseudo-classicist, and
popularizer, and Decadent hyper-aesthete. That which was the
vulnerable point in the original production—its two-fold plot—has
been still for every imitator a stone of stumbling. Rowe tried
to escape it by the suppression of the antecedent half, and the
fraction which remained in his hand was an artificial thing without
the breath of life, that had to be attenuated and padded out
with speechifying to fill the compass of its five Acts. Beer-Hofmann
tried to escape it by superimposing an idea not proper to the
story, and beneath the weight of this his tragedy collapsed in the
middle, for its addition over-packed the drama, and left him not
room enough to make convincing the conduct of his characters.
The first essayers, who attacked in straightforward fashion their
unwieldy theme, succeeded best; all attempts to obviate its essential
defect have marred rather than mended. Perhaps the theme
is by its nature unsuited to dramatic treatment, and yet there is
much that is dramatic about that theme, as is evinced by the fact
that playwrights have been unable to let it lie.</p>

<h2>EDITOR’S NOTE ON TEXT</h2>


<p>The present text aims to reproduce exactly the Quarto edition of
1632, retaining its punctuation, spelling, capitals, italics, and stage
directions—amending only the metrical alignment.<a id="marker-14" href="#footnote-14" class="marker" title="Footnote 14">14</a> Mere mistakes of
printing—inverted and broken letters—are restored, but are duly catalogued
in the <a href="#linenotes">foot notes</a>. The division into scenes, as made by Gifford,
and his affixment of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">locus</i> of each, are inserted into the text, inclosed
in brackets. In the foot notes are recorded all variants of all subsequent
editions. Differences of punctuation are given, if they could
possibly alter the meaning, but not otherwise—nor mere differences
<em>in wording</em> of stage directions, nor differences in spelling, nor elision
for metre. In the Quarto the elder Novall is sometimes designated
before his lines as <i>Novall Senior</i>, sometimes merely as <i>Novall</i>—no confusion
is possible, since he and his son are never on the stage at the
same time. Gifford and Symons always write <i>Novall Senior</i>, while
Coxeter and Mason write <i>Novall</i> alone in <a href="#act-I-i">I, i</a>, and <i>Novall Senior</i> thereafter.
I have not thought it worth while to note the variants of the
several texts on this point.</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>


<p>[<i><a href="#dramatis-personae">Dramatis personae</a>.</i>] <i>Charalois</i>—the name <i>Charalois</i> is a corruption
of <i>Charolais</i>, the Count of Charolais being the hereditary title of the
heir-apparent of the Duchy of Burgundy, for whom the county of
Charolais, an arrière-fief of Burgundy, was reserved as an appanage.
This domain had been purchased by Philip the Bold for his son, John the
Fearless.</p>

<p><a href="#act-I-i">I, i, 4</a>. <i>argue me of</i>—obsolete construction: “accuse me of.” Cf. Ray,
<i>Disc.</i> II, v, 213: “Erroneously argues Hubert Thomas ... of a mistake.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-5">I, i, 7</a>. <i>dispence with</i>—give special exemption from. Cf. <a href="#line-I-ii-85">I, ii, 87</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-30">I, i, 33</a>. <i>This such</i>—<i>This</i> for <i>this is</i> is a common Elizabethan construction.
Cf. “O this the poison of deep grief”—<cite>Hamlet</cite>, IV, v, 76; “This a
good block”—<cite>Lear</cite>, IV, vi, 187.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-45">I, i, 45</a>. <i>tooke vp</i>—borrowed. Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Henry IV, Part II</cite>,
I, ii, 46: “if a man is through with them in honest taking up, they stand
upon security.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-55">I, i, 55–6</a>. <i>Your sable habit, with the hat and cloak ... haue power</i>—the
details of hat, cloak, and ribbons, interposed between subject and verb,
have attracted the latter into the plural, to the violation of its agreement
with its substantive.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-70">I, i, 70</a>. <i>in that</i>—i.&nbsp;e., in the fact that justice had no such guards.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-70">I, i, 73–7</a>. For the allusion to <i>Cerberus</i> and the <i>sops</i>, cf. Virgil’s picture
of Aeneas’ journey to Hades (Aeneid, VI, 417–425): “Huge Cerberus
makes these realms to resound with barking from his tripple jaws,
stretched at his enormous length in a den that fronts the gate. To whom
the prophetess, seeing his neck now bristle with horrid snakes, flings a
soporific cake of honey and medicated grain. He, in the mad rage of
hunger, opening his three mouths, snatches the offered morsel, and, spread
on the ground, relaxes his monstrous limbs, and is extended at vast length
over all the cave. Aeneas, now that the keeper [of Hell] is buried [in
sleep], seizes the passage and swift overpasses the bank of that flood
whence there is no return.”—<cite>Davidson’s trans.</cite></p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-75">I, i, 75</a>. <i>fertyle headed—many headed</i>, <i>fertyle</i> is used in the now
obsolete sense of <i>abundant</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-90">I, i, 92</a>. <i>such, whose</i>—for the construction, cf. Shakespeare: “Such I
will have, whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy.”—<cite>All’s Well</cite>,
III, iv, 24.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-95">I, i, 99</a>. <i>men religious</i>—the adjective is regularly placed after its noun
in Eliz. Eng. when the substantive is unemphatic and the modifier not a
mere epithet, but essential to the sense. See Abbott, S.&nbsp;G. § 419.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-135">I, i, 137–8</a>.—The thought of these lines is undeveloped, the phrasing
being broken and disconnected. It is a scornful observation on the part
<a id="page-148" href="#page-148" class="pagenum" title="148"> </a>
of Romont that whether or not Novall takes papers depends on how the
matter is brought before him—and he is about to add that there is a way
in which Charalois can manage to gain his point, when he breaks off with
the cry, “Follow him!” <i>Conuayance</i> = contrivance.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-160">I, i, 164</a>. <i>parchment toils</i>—snares in the shape of documents upon
parchment, such as bonds, mortgages, etc.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-i-165">I, i, 166</a>. <i>Luxury</i>—used here in the modern sense,—not, as more commonly
in Elizabethan times, with the meaning, <i>laciviousness</i>, <i>lust</i>. The
thought of the somewhat involved period which ends with this line is,
that the creditors prayed only on an occasion when they feared to lose
their clutch on some rich spendthrift—on which occasion they would
pray to the devil to invent some new and fantastic pleasure which would
lure their victim back into the toils.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-10">I, ii, 11</a>. <i>Dijon</i>—the scene of the drama,—situated on the western
border of the fertile plain of Burgundy, and at the confluence of the
Ouche and the Suzon. It was formerly the capital of the province of
Burgundy, the dukes of which acquired it early in the eleventh century,
and took up their residence there in the thirteenth century. For the
decoration of the palace and other monuments built by them, eminent
artists were gathered from northern France and Flanders, and during
this period the town became one of the great intellectual centers of
France. The union of the duchy with the crown in 1477 deprived Dijon
of the splendor of the ducal court, but to counterbalance this loss it was
made the capital of the province and the seat of a <i>parlement</i>. To-day it
possesses a population of some 65,000, and is a place of considerable importance.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-20">I, ii, 21–3</a>. <i>Nor now ... that I vndertooke, forsake it.</i>—The expression
is elliptical, the verb of the preceding period being in the future indicative—whereas
here the incomplete verb is in the conditional mood. In full:
<i>Nor now ... that I undertook, would I forsake it.</i></p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-55">I, ii, 56</a>. <i>determine of—of</i> is the preposition in obs. usage which follows
<i>determine</i> used, as here, in the sense of <i>decide</i>, <i>come to a judicial
decision</i>, <i>come to a decision on</i> (<i>upon</i>). Cf. <a href="#line-IV-iv-80">IV, iv, 82</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-55">I, ii, 57</a>. <i>to</i>—in addition to.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-65">I, ii, 66</a>. <i>become</i>—modern editors, beginning with Mason, read <i>became</i>;
but <i>become</i> may be taken as a variant form of the past tense (or even as
participle for <i>having become</i>, with nom. absolute construction, though
this is less likely).</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-90">I, ii, 91–2</a>. <i>May force you ... plead at</i>—i.&nbsp;e. “may cause your dismissal
from the bar.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-105">I, ii, 107</a>. <i>purple-colour’d</i>—Novall wears the official red robe of judge.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-120">I, ii, 123–4</a>. <i>the subtill Fox of France, The politique Lewis</i>—Louis XI
of France, an old enemy of Burgundy.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-125">I, ii, 127</a>. <i>If that</i>, etc.—Gradually, as the interrogatives were recognized
as relatives, the force of <i>that</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>as</i>, in “when <i>that</i>”, “when <i>so</i>”, “when
<i>as</i>”, seems to have tended to make the relative more general and indefinite;
<a id="page-149" href="#page-149" class="pagenum" title="149"> </a>
“who so” being now nearly (and once quite) as indefinite as “whosoever.”...
In this sense, by analogy, <i>that</i> was attached to other words, such
as “if”, “though”, “why”, etc.—Abbott, S.&nbsp;G. § 287.</p>

<p>Cf.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-20">“If that rebellion</div>

<p class="continued">The same construction appears in <a href="#line-V-iii-95">V, iii, 95</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-160">I, ii, 163</a>. <i>Writ man</i>—i.&nbsp;e., wrote himself down as a man.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-170">I, ii, 170</a>. <i>Granson</i>, <i>Morat</i>, <i>Nancy</i>—the “three memorable overthrows”
which Charles the Bold suffered at the hands of the Swiss cantons and Duke
René of Loraine. The battle of Granson took place March 3, 1476; that
of Morat, June 22, 1476; that of Nancy, January 5, 1477. On each occasion
the army of Charles was annihilated; and finally at Nancy he was
himself slain. These defeats ended the power of Burgundy.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-170">I, ii, 171</a>. <i>The warlike Charloyes</i>—Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-185">I, ii, 185</a>. <i>Ill ayres</i>—noxious exhalations, miasma.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-200">I, ii, 201</a>. <i>right</i>—so in all texts. With this word the meaning is perfectly
plain, but the substitution, in its place, of <i>weight</i> would better sustain
the figure used in the preceding line. <i>Weight</i> is a word which it is not
unlikely the printer would mis-read from the Ms. as <i>right</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-205">I, ii, 207</a>. <i>in your danger</i>—regularly, “in your power”, “at your
mercy”; so here, “in your debt”.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-245">I, ii, 245</a>. <i>As</i>—used here in its demonstrative meaning, to introduce a
parenthetical clause. Cf. Abbott, S.&nbsp;G. § 110.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-10">II, i, 13</a>. <i>sits</i>—the common Elizabethan 3rd. person plural in <i>s</i>, generally
and without warrant altered by modern editors. See Abbott, S.&nbsp;G. § 333.
Cf. <i>keepes</i>, <a href="#line-V-ii-35">V, ii, 37</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-25">II, i, 28</a>. <i>was—monies</i> is taken in the collective sense.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-45">II, i, 46</a>. <i>interd a liuely graue</i>—i.&nbsp;e., <i>enter’d a lively</i> [<i>living</i>] <i>grave</i>. G.,
who first prints it so, considers he has made a change in the first word,
taking it in the Q. for <i>interr’d</i>, as does M., who suggests in a footnote the
reading: <i>enters alive the grave</i>. But <i>interd</i> may be, and is best, taken as
merely an old spelling for <i>enter’d</i>, naturally attracted to the <i>i</i>-form by the
presence of the word <i>interment</i> in the preceding line.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-60">II, i, 63</a>. <i>Remember best, forget not gratitude</i>—ellipsis for: <i>Remember
best who forget not gratitude</i>. Modern usage confines the omission of the
relative mostly to the objective. In Eliz. Eng., however, the nominative
<a id="page-150" href="#page-150" class="pagenum" title="150"> </a>
relative was even more frequently omitted, especially when the antecedent
clause was emphatic and evidently incomplete, and where the antecedent immediately
preceded the verb to which the relative would be subject. See
Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 244.</p>

<p class="continued">Cf. <a href="#line-III-i-130">III, i, 134–5</a>; <a href="#line-III-i-135">i, 139</a>; <a href="#line-III-i-330">i, 332</a>; <a href="#line-IV-ii-60">IV, ii, 61</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-65">II, i, 65</a>. <i>viperous</i>—according to various classical authorities [e.&nbsp;g., Pliny,
X, 82], the young of vipers eat their way forth to light through the bowels of
their dam. The figure here seems to be somewhat confused, as the dead
hero is the <i>son</i> of the country, his mother, who devours <i>him</i>. The thought,
perhaps, in the mind of the dramatist, albeit ill-expressed, was that the
mother-country owed her existence to her son, and, viper-like had devoured
the author of her life.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-65">II, i, 66</a>. <i>eate</i>—owing to the tendency to drop the inflectional ending <i>-en</i>,
the Elizabethans frequently used the curtailed forms of past participles,
which are common in Early English: “I have spoke, forgot, writ, chid,”
etc.—Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 343. Cf. <i>broke</i>, <a href="#line-II-ii-25">II, ii, 27</a>; <i>spoke</i>, <a href="#act-III-i">III, i, 3</a>; <i>begot</i>,
<a href="#line-IV-iv-150">IV, iv, 154</a>; <a href="#line-IV-iv-170">170</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-80">II, i, 83</a>. <i>golden calf</i>—the figure, from its immediate application to <i>a
dolt of great wealth</i>, is transferred to the false god whom the children of
Israel worshipped at the foot of Mount Sinaï.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-90">II, i, 93–4</a>. <i>Would they not so</i>, etc.—the Q. reading is to be preferred
to either of the modern emendations. It is probably in the sense of
“Would they no more but so?”, with the ensuing declaration that in that
case they would keep their tears to stop (fill?) bottles (probably meaning
lachrimatories or phials used in ancient times for the preservation of tears
of mourning).</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-95">II, i, 98–9</a>. <i>Y’are ne’re content, Crying nor laughing</i>—The meaning is,
of course: “You are never content with us, whether we are crying or
laughing.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-100">II, i, 100</a>. <i>Both with a birth</i>—i.&nbsp;e., both together, at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-135">II, i, 137</a>. <i>Burmudas</i>—The Bermuda islands, known only through the
tales of early navigators who suffered shipwreck there, enjoyed a most
unsavory reputation in Elizabethan times, as being the seat of continual
tempests, and the surrounding waters “a hellish sea for thunder, lightning,
and storms.” Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>The Tempest</cite>, I, ii, 269: “the still-vexed
Bermoothes.” They were said to be enchanted, and inhabited by witches
and devils. They were made famous by the shipwreck there in 1609 of
Sir George Somers; the following year one of his party, Sil. Jordan, published
<cite>A Discovery of the Bermudas, otherwise called the Isle of Devils</cite>.</p>

<p>Field has another reference to “the Barmuthoes” in <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>,
III, iv; but there it is not clear whether he means the islands or certain
narrow passages north of Covent Garden, which went by the slang name
of “the Bermudas” or “the Streights.” It <i>is</i> in this latter sense that the
word is used in Jonson’s <cite>The Devil is an Ass</cite>, II, i.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-i-135">II, i, 139</a>. <i>Exact the strictnesse</i>—i.&nbsp;e., require a strict enforcement of
the sentence which limits Charalois to the confines of the prison.</p>

<p><a id="page-151" href="#page-151" class="pagenum" title="151"> </a>
<a href="#line-II-i-140">II, i, 144</a>. <i>vsurers relief</i>, etc.—a rather awkward expression, so phrased
for the sake of the end-scene rhyme. The thought seems to be: “The
relief which usurers have to offer mourns, if the debtors have (exhibit)
too much grief.” Charalois’ remark is, of course, ironical.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-10">II, ii, 10</a>. <i>electuary</i>—a medicinal conserve or paste, consisting of a powder
or some other ingredient mixed with honey, preserve, or syrup of
some other kind. Beaumelle means that Florimal is the medicine and
Bellapert the sweet which makes it palatable.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-15">II, ii, 17</a>. <i>serue</i>—G. and S. read <i>served</i>, which is certainly correct.
Not only is there nothing throughout the play to suggest that Beaumelle’s
mother is still alive, but she herself has just spoken of “you two my
women” (<a href="#line-II-ii-10">l.&nbsp;11</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-15">II, ii, 18</a>. <i>a peepe out</i>—a “pip” [old spelling <i>peepe</i>] is one of the spots
on playing cards, dice, or dominoes. The allusion is to a game of cards
called “one-and-thirty”; thirty-two is a pip too many.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-20">II, ii, 21–2</a>. <i>the mother of the maydes</i>—a title properly applied to the
head of the maids of honour in a Royal household.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-20">II, ii, 22</a>. <i>mortifie</i>—there is a significant ambiguity to the word Bellapert
uses. It means “bring into subjection,” “render dead to the world
and the flesh;” it formerly had also a baleful meaning: “to kill;” “to
destroy the vitality, vigor, or activity of.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-30">II, ii, 32</a>. <i>vanuable, to make you thus—valuable</i> is used in its generic
sense of <i>value-able</i>, <i>of sufficient value</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-70">II, ii, 71</a>. <i>turn’d in her varieties</i>—G., S. read: <i>trimm’d in her varieties</i>—i.&nbsp;e.,
“decked in her varieties [varied aspects].” But adherence to the
Q. is possible, with the meaning, “fashioned in her varieties.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-80">II, ii, 82</a>. <i>walkes not vnder a weede</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “wears not a garment,” “is
not in existence.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-85">II, ii, 88</a>. <i>Tissue</i>—a rich kind of cloth, often interwoven with gold or
silver. So again in <a href="#line-II-ii-175">II, ii, 175</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-85">II, ii, 89</a>. <i>a three-leg’d lord</i>—the meaning is that Young Novall cannot
independently “stand upon his own legs,” but requires the triple support
of himself, Liladam, and Aymer.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-95">II, ii, 96</a>. <i>musicke house</i>—a public hall or saloon for musical performances.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-95">II, ii, 99–100</a>. <i>in the Galley foyst</i>, etc.—a Galley-foist was a state barge,
especially that of the Lord Mayor of London. This, however, can hardly
be the meaning of the word here, used as it is in connection with <i>Bullion</i>,
which were trunk-hose, puffed out at the upper part, in several folds; and
with <i>Quirpo</i>, a variant of <i>cuerpo</i>—i.&nbsp;e., <i>in undress</i>. “Galley-foist” may
be the name of some dress of the period, so-called for its resemblance to
the gaily bedecked Mayor’s-barge. But it is not unlikely, as Mason suggests,
that <i>The Galley-foist</i> and <i>The Bullion</i> were the names of taverns of
that day; or else of houses of public resort for some kind of amusement.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-100">II, ii, 104</a>. <i>skip</i>—so in all texts. But Field has elsewhere (<cite>Woman is
a Weathercock</cite>, II, i.): “and then my lord ... casts a suit every quarter,
<a id="page-152" href="#page-152" class="pagenum" title="152"> </a>
which I <i>slip</i> into.” It is probable that the word was the same in both
passages,—though whether <i>skip</i> or <i>slip</i> I have no means of determining.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-115">II, ii, 119</a>. <i>St Omers</i>—more properly, <i>St. Omer</i>, a town of northern
France. A College of Jesuits was located there, and the point of Novall’s
comparison is perhaps an allusion to the mean appearance of Jesuit spies
who would come from thence to England on some pretext, such as to see
their friends during the Christmas season.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-120">II, ii, 122</a>. <i>ly’n perdieu</i>—“to lie perdu” is properly a military term for,
“to be placed as a sentinel or outpost,” especially in an exposed position.
<i>Ly’n</i> is one of the many obsolete forms of the past participle of the verb
“to lie.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-125">II, ii, 125</a>. <i>tye my hand</i>—i.&nbsp;e., tie the ribbon-strings which depended
from the sleeve over the hand.</p>

<p><a href="#line-I-ii-160">II, ii, 163</a>. <i>slight neglect</i>—contemptuous disrespect.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-170">II, ii, 174</a>. <i>bile</i>—all editors after the Q. read <i>boil</i>. <i>Bile</i> was an old
spelling for <i>boil</i>; but in the other sense, one of the “four humours” of
medieval physiology, the passage is perfectly clear, and the figure perhaps
even more effective.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-185">II, ii, 186</a>. <i>eager relish</i>—acrid taste. The figure is that the law in itself
is often like a sharp and bitter flavor, but that a good judge will sweeten
this.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-250">II, ii, 250</a> <i>s.&nbsp;d.</i> <i>Drawes a Curtayne</i>—the curtain of the alcove or back-stage,
within which was placed the “treasure,” thus to be revealed.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-295">II, ii, 298</a>. <i>in which yours</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “because of the fact of her being
yours.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-300">II, ii, 301</a>. <i>for poore and worthlesse I—I</i> for <i>me</i>, like other irregularities
in pronominal inflection, was not infrequent in Elizabethan times. Cf.
Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 205.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-325">II, ii, 326</a>. <i>Curtius-like</i>—like Marcus Curtius, legendary hero of ancient
Rome. See Livy, vii, 6.</p>

<p><a href="#line-II-ii-350">II, ii, <i>final s.&nbsp;d.</i></a> <i>while the Act is playing</i>—i.&nbsp;e., while the interlude music
is played, at the close of the Act.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-15">III, i, 18</a>. <i>relish</i>—a trace or tinge of some quality, a suggestion.—In
<a href="#line-III-i-20">III, i, 20</a>: <i>a flavor</i>; or, if read with the Q.’s punctuation, a verb:
<i>give a relish</i>. It appears preferable, however, to take the passage as punctuated
by G., S., which makes <i>relish</i> a noun.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-25">III, i, 29</a>. <i>take me with you</i>—understand me.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-35">III, i, 37</a>. <i>sudden</i>—adv. for <i>suddenly</i>. The <i>-ly</i> suffix was frequently
omitted in Elizabethan times.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-45">III, i, 45</a>. <i>Such as are faire</i>, etc.—the connection goes back to <a href="#line-III-i-40">l.&nbsp;42</a>,
Bellapert taking up again the thread of her remark which Novall’s objection
and her summary answer thereto had broken in upon.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-120">III, i, 120</a>. <i>Christian</i>—probably used here in the colloq. sense of: <i>a
human being</i>, as distinguished from a brute; a “decent” or “respectable”
person. Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, I, iii, 89: “Methinks ... I have
no more wit than a Christian, or an ordinary man has.”</p>

<p><a id="page-153" href="#page-153" class="pagenum" title="153"> </a>
<a href="#line-III-i-120">III, i, 122</a>. <i>The entertaiment of your visitation</i>—i.&nbsp;e., the entertainment
which your visit received.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-120">III, i, 123</a>. <i>on</i> [old spelling for <i>one</i>]—i.&nbsp;e., a visitation.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-125">III, i, 126</a>. <i>Muske-cat</i>—the civet-cat; applied as a term of contempt to
a fop, as being a person perfumed with musk.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-135">III, i, 139</a>. <i>there is now speaks to you</i>—G., S. omit <i>is</i>, at the same time
clearing the construction and securing a more regular metre. The Q.
reading, however, is perfectly possible, as an ellipsis, by omission of the
subject relative, for, <i>there is that now speaks to you</i> [i.&nbsp;e., <i>there is now
speaking to you</i>], or even, by a change of punctuation, <i>there is—now
speaks to you</i>—, etc.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-145">III, i, 148</a>. <i>As Caesar, did he liue, could not except at</i>—see Plutarch’s
<cite>Life of Julius Caesar</cite>, Chapters 9 &amp; 10, wherein it is narrated how Caesar
divorced his wife, Pompeia, when scandal assailed her name, although he
denied any knowledge as to her guilt; “‘Because’ said he, ‘I would have
the chastity of my wife clear even of suspicion.’”</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-145">III, i, 148</a>. <i>except at</i>—take exception at.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-155">III, i, 159</a>. <i>pointed</i>—all editors after the Q. read <i>painted</i>, an absolutely
unnecessary and unwarranted emendation. <i>Pointed</i> means “fitted or furnished
with tagged points or laces;” “wearing points;” “laced.” Cf.
Maurice Hewlett’s novel, <cite>The Queen’s Quair</cite>, p.&nbsp;83: “saucy young men,
trunked, puffed, pointed, trussed and doubleted.” Huloet in his Dictionary
(1552) has: “Poynted, or tyed with poynts, <i>ligulatus</i>.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-165">III, i, 167</a>. <i>This pretty rag</i>—i.&nbsp;e., the “clout” mentioned in <a href="#line-II-ii-120">II, ii, 123</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-170">III, i, 173</a>. <i>in spite of</i>—in scorn of, in defiance of.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-180">III, i, 184</a>. <i>thy</i>—so the Q. All later editors read <i>this</i>. It is not impossible,
of course, that Romont should begin an oath “By thy hand,” and
Beaumelle flash back at him “And sword,” transferring the <i>thy</i> from herself
to him. But Romont would be more likely to swear by his own hand
than by Beaumelle’s.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-185">III, i, 188</a>. <i>cast suburb whores</i>—prostitutes who had been cashiered
from service. Houses of ill-fame were customarily located in the suburbs.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-190">III, i, 191</a>. <i>legion</i>—i.&nbsp;e., of evil spirits. Cf. <cite>Mark</cite>, v, 9.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-190">III, i, 193</a>. <i>horne-mad</i>—the word was originally applied to horned
beasts, in the sense: “enraged so as to horn any one;” hence of persons:
“stark mad,” “mad with rage,” “furious.” By word-play it acquires its
sense in the present passage. “mad with rage at having been made a
cuckold.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-200">III, i, 202</a>. <i>yellow</i>—this color was regarded as a token or symbol of
jealousy.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-210">III, i, 211</a>. <i>Carted</i>—carried in a cart through the streets, by way of
punishment or public exposure (especially as the punishment of a bawd).</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-260">III, i, 261</a>. <i>in distance</i>—within reach, in striking distance.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-330">III, i, 331</a>. <i>as it would tire—as</i> appears to be used for <i>as if</i>; in reality
the <i>if</i> is implied in the (conditional) subjunctive.—Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 107.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-330">III, i, 331</a>. <i>a beadle</i>—it was one of the duties of a beadle to whip petty
offenders.</p>

<p><a id="page-154" href="#page-154" class="pagenum" title="154"> </a>
<a href="#line-III-i-350">III, i, 352</a>. <i>So I not heard them</i>—Abbott explains this construction, not
uncommon in the Elizabethan period, as an omission of the auxiliary verb
“do” (S.&nbsp;G. § 305). But here the main verb is <i>heard</i>, whereas, according
to his explanation, grammar would require <i>hear</i>. May not the construction
be better taken as a simple, though to our ears cumbrous, inversion
of, <i>So I heard them not</i>?</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-365">III, i, 366</a>. <i>cause</i>—affair, business—so also in <a href="#line-III-i-375">III, i, 377</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-385">III, i, 388</a>. <i>Calenture</i>—a disease incident to sailors within the tropics;
a burning fever.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-425">III, i, 428–9</a>. <i>flegme ... choller</i>—in the old physiologies the predominance
of the “humour, phlegm,” was held to cause constitutional indolence
or apathy,—the predominance of “choler” to cause irascibility.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-430">III, i, 432</a>. <i>’em</i>—grammatical precision would require <i>him</i>, as is substituted
in M., f. In Field’s rapid, loose style, however, a change of construction
in mid-sentence is not improbable, and the Q. reading may very
well reproduce accurately what he wrote.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-440">III, i, 441</a>. <i>thou curious impertinent</i>—the epithet is from <i>The Curious
Impertinent</i> of Cervantes, a story imbedded in <cite>Don Quixote, Part I</cite>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-460">III, i, 463</a>. <i>I not accuse</i>—cf. note on l.&nbsp;354.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-465">III, i, 467</a>. <i>Ere liue—Ere I should live</i> is required in full by strict
grammar, but Field’s verse is frequently elliptical. Gifford’s emendation
to <i>lived</i> for the sake of grammatical regularity, which is followed by all
later editors, is unwarranted.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-465">III, i, 467</a>. <i>mens marginall fingers</i>—the figure is an allusion to the
ancient custom of placing an index hand in the margin of books, to direct
the reader’s attention to a striking passage. So does Romont picture men’s
fingers pointing to the story of Charalois as a noteworthy and lamentable
thing. Cf. <a href="#line-IV-i-55">IV, i, 56</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-III-i-465">III, i, 469–470</a>. <i>An Emperour put away his wife for touching Another
man.</i>—The source of this allusion is not apparent. Can it be a perversion
in the mind of Field of the story of Caesar’s divorce of his wife, to which
Massinger has already referred above (<a href="#line-III-i-145">l.&nbsp;148</a>)?</p>

<p><a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i, 3</a>. <i>a flaxe</i>—the flax wick of a lamp or candle.</p>

<p><a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i, 3</a>. <i>a red headed womans chamber</i>—Since early times red-haired
individuals have been supposed to emit an emanation having a powerful
sexually exciting influence. In the Romance countries, France and Italy,
this belief is universally diffused.—Iwan Block: <cite>The Sexual Life of our
Time</cite>—transl. by Eden Paul—p.&nbsp;622.</p>

<p>Cf. also Gabrielle D’Annunzio: <cite>Il Piacere</cite>, p.&nbsp;90:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“‘Have you noticed the armpits of Madame Chrysoloras? Look!’”</p>

<p>“The Duke di Beffi indicated a dancer, who had upon her brow, white
as a marble of Luni, a firebrand of red tresses, like a priestess of Alma
Tadema. Her bodice was fastened on the shoulders by mere ribbons,
and there were revealed beneath the armpits two luxuriant tufts of red
hair.</p>

<p>“Bomminaco began to discourse upon the peculiar odour which red-haired
women have.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a id="page-155" href="#page-155" class="pagenum" title="155"> </a>
<a href="#line-IV-i-10">IV, i, 13</a>. <i>Cell</i>—so in the Q. and all later texts. Yet the word is utterly
unsatisfactory to the sense of the passage; it should almost certainly be
<i>coil</i>—i.&nbsp;e., tumult, confusion, fuss, ado. Cf. Field in <cite>Amends for Ladies</cite>,
II, iv: “Here’s a coil with a lord and his sister.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-20">IV, i, 23</a>. <i>a lace</i>—a trimming of lace.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-25">IV, i, 27</a>. <i>pickadille</i>—the expansive collar fashionable in the early part
of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-25">IV, i, 27</a>. <i>in puncto</i>—in point; i.&nbsp;e., in proper condition, in order.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-30">IV, i, 32</a>. <i>Iacobs staffe</i>—an instrument formerly used for measuring
the altitude of the sun; a cross-staff.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-30">IV, i, 32</a>. <i>Ephimerides</i>—a table showing the positions of a heavenly
body for a series of successive days.</p>

cut one’s coat after one’s cloth” was: “to adapt one’s self to circumstances;”
“to measure expense by income.” The point of its employment
here is not plain; it is doubtful if anything were very clear in Field’s own
mind, who was merely trying to hit off an epigrammatical phrase. Perhaps,
“make the coat match the man.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-70">IV, i, 72</a>. <i>Narcissus-like</i>—like Narcissus, in classic myth. See Ovid,
<cite>Meta.</cite>, iii, 341–510.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-70">IV, i, 72</a>. <i>should</i>—G., f. read <i>shouldst</i>, but the breach of agreement
between subject and verb is to be explained by the attraction of the verb
to the third person by the interposed <i>Narcissus-like</i>; just as four lines
further on we find <i>shouldst</i> for <i>should</i>, because of the similar intrusion
between subject and verb of (<i>but thy selfe sweete Lord</i>).</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-90">IV, i, 92</a>. <i>a Barber Surgeon</i>—formerly the barber was also a regular
practitioner in surgery and dentistry. Cf. Beaumont &amp; Fletcher, <cite>The
Knight of the Burning Pestle</cite>, III, iv.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-95">IV, i, 96</a>. <i>ouerthrowne</i>—M., f. read <i>overflown</i>, i.&nbsp;e., become excessive
or inordinate; so full that the contents run over the brim. The reading
of the Q., however, is quite intelligible,—taking <i>overthrown</i> in the sense
of <i>thrown too strongly</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-135">IV, i, 135</a>. <i>Colbran</i>—more properly <i>Colbrand</i> or <i>Collebrand</i>, a wicked
giant in the medieval romance of Guy of Warwick. He is the champion
of the invading King of Denmark, who challenges the English King,
Athelstan, to produce a knight who can vanquish Colbrand, or to yield as
his vassal. In this hour of need Guy appears, fights with the giant, and
kills him.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-135">IV, i, 137</a>. <i>hee’l make some of you smoake</i>,—i.&nbsp;e., “make some of you
<i>suffer</i>.” Cf. Beaumont &amp; Fletcher, <cite>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</cite>, I,
ii, 136: “I’ll make some of ’em smoke for’t;” and Shakespeare, <cite>Titus
Andronicus</cite>, IV, iii, 111: “Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-135">IV, i, 138</a>. <i>a Consort</i>—“In the author’s age, the taverns were infested
with itinerant bands of musicians, each of which (jointly and individually)
was called a noise or <i>consort</i>: these were sometimes invited to play for the
company, but seem more frequently to have thrust themselves, unasked,
<a id="page-156" href="#page-156" class="pagenum" title="156"> </a>
into it, with an offer of their services: their intrusion was usually prefaced
with, ‘By your leave, gentlemen, will you hear any music?’”—Gifford.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-145">IV, i, 145</a>. <i>of</i>—formerly sometimes substituted, as here, for <i>on</i> in colloquial
usage. So also <i>on</i> for <i>of</i>, as in <a href="#line-IV-i-145">l.&nbsp;148</a>. Cf. also <a href="#line-IV-i-180">l.&nbsp;182</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-195">IV, i, 197–8</a>. <i>’tis Fairies treasure Which but reueal’d brings on the
blabbers ruine.</i>—To confide in any one about a fairy’s gift rendered it
void, according to popular tradition, and drew down the fairy giver’s
anger. In instance, see John Aubrey’s <cite>Remains</cite> (Reprinted in <cite>Publications
of the Folk-Lore Society</cite>, vol. IV, p.&nbsp;102): “Not far from Sir
Bennet Hoskyns, there was a labouring man, that rose up early every day
to go to worke; who for a good while many dayes together found a nine-pence
in the way that he went. His wife wondering how he came by so
much money, was afraid he gott it not honestlye; at last he told her, and
afterwards he never found any more.”</p>

<p>There are numerous literary allusions to this superstition: e.&nbsp;g., Shakespeare,
<cite>The Winter’s Tale</cite>, III, iii, 127, ff.: “This is fairy gold, boy; and
’twill prove so. Up with’t, keep it close.... We are lucky, boy; and to be
so still requires nothing but secrecy.”</p>

<p>And Field himself in <cite>Woman is a Weathercock</cite>, I, i:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line quote">“I see you labour with some serious thing,</div>
<div class="line">And think (like fairy’s treasure) to reveal it,</div>
<div class="line">Will cause it vanish.”</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#line-IV-i-210">IV, i, 210–1</a>. <i>louers periury</i>, etc.—that Jove laughed at and overlooked
lovers’ perjuries was a familiar proverb. Cf. Massinger, <cite>The Parliament
of Love</cite>, C-G. 192 a: “Jupiter and Venus smile At lovers’ perjuries;” and
Shakespeare, <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, II, ii, 92: “at lovers’ perjuries, They say,
Jove laughs.” The saying goes back to Ovid’s <cite>Art of Love</cite>, book I;—as
Marlowe has translated it:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line quote">“For Jove himself sits in the azure skies,</div>
<div class="line">And laughs below at lovers’ perjuries.”</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#line-IV-ii-70">IV, ii, 71</a>. <i>On all aduantage take thy life</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “Taking every advantage
of you, kill you.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-ii-80">IV, ii, 84</a>. Such whose bloods wrongs, or wrong done to <i>themselues</i>—the
Q.’s regular omission of the possessive apostrophe has in this instance
confused later editors in their understanding of the passage. We would
write <i>blood’s</i>,—with the meaning: “Those whom wrongs to kindred or to
themselves,” etc.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iii-10">IV, iii, 12</a>. <i>so</i>—there is no direct antecedent, but one is easily understandable
from the general sense of what precedes; <i>to be so</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “as
you were in thankfulness to the General.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iv-10">IV, iv, 10</a>. <i>it</i>—another case of a pronoun with antecedent merely implied
in the general sense of what precedes; <i>it</i> = “the fact that I am not
worthy the looking on, but only,” etc.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iv-30">IV, iv, 30</a>. <i>such defence</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “the defence of such a one.” <i>Such</i> =
qualis.</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iv-65">IV, iv, 66</a>. <i>To this</i>—i.&nbsp;e., to tears.</p>

<p><a id="page-157" href="#page-157" class="pagenum" title="157"> </a>
<a href="#line-IV-iv-70">IV, iv, 70</a>. <i>those fam’d matrones</i>—cf. Massinger in <cite>The Virgin Martyr</cite>,
C-G. 33 a:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line quote">“You will rise up with reverence, and no more,</div>
<div class="line">As things unworthy of your thoughts, remember</div>
<div class="line">What the canonized Spartan ladies were,</div>
<div class="line">Which lying Greece so boasts of. Your own matrons,</div>

<div class="line">With this is to be mention’d.”</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iv-110">IV, iv, 112</a>. <i>on it</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “on what you say.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-IV-iv-155">IV, iv, 156</a>. <i>be</i>—“be” expresses more doubt than “is” after a verb of
<i>thinking</i>. Cf. Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 299.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-5">V, i, 5</a>. <i>lay me vp</i>—imprison me.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-5">V, i, 7</a>. <i>varlets</i>—the name given to city bailiffs or sergeants. Perhaps
here, however, it is applied merely as a term of abuse.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-5">V, i, 9</a>. <i>Innes of court man</i>—a member of one of the four Inns of
Court (The Inner Temple, The Middle Temple, Lincoln’s Inn, and Gray’s
Inn), legal societies which served for the Elizabethan the function which
our law-schools perform to-day. Overbury says of the Inns of Court
Man, in his <cite>Characters</cite>: “Hee is distinguished from a scholler by a pair
of silk-stockings, and a beaver hat, which make him contemn a scholler
as much as a scholler doth a school-master.... He is as far behind a
courtier in his fashion, as a scholler is behind him.... He laughs at every
man whose band sits not well, or that hath not a faire shoo-tie, and he is
ashamed to be seen in any mans company that weares not his clothes well.
His very essence he placeth in his outside.... You shall never see him
melancholy, but when he wants a new suit, or feares a sergeant....”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-10">V, i, 13</a>. <i>coming forth</i>—appearance in court, or from prison.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-25">V, i, 28</a>. <i>manchets</i>—small loaves or rolls of the finest wheaten bread.
There seems to have been a commonplace concerning the huge quantities
of bread devoured by tailors. Cf. <a href="#line-V-i-85">l.&nbsp;88</a> below, and Note.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-30">V, i, 31</a>. <i>leaue swordmen</i>—i.&nbsp;e., swordmen (swaggering ruffians who
claim the profession of arms) <i>on leave</i>. It is possible, however, that
<i>leaue</i> is a misprint (by inversion of a letter) for <i>leane</i> = hungry.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-80">V, i, 83</a>. <i>hangers</i>—not “short-swords”, as in <a href="#line-V-i-30">l.&nbsp;31</a>, but here “pendants”,
perhaps a part of the hat-band hanging loose, or else loops or
straps on the swordbelt, often richly ornamented, from which the sword
was hung. Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, V, ii, 157–167.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-80">V, i, 83</a>. <i>Hell</i>—a place under a tailor’s shop-board, in which shreds or
pieces of cloth, cut off in the process of cutting clothes, are thrown, and
looked upon as perquisites. Cf. Overbury’s <cite>Characters, A Taylor</cite>: “Hee
<a id="page-158" href="#page-158" class="pagenum" title="158"> </a>
differeth altogether from God; for with him the best pieces are still
marked out for damnation, and without hope of recovery shall be cast
down into hell.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-85">V, i, 88</a>. <i>Our breakefasts famous for the buttred loaues</i>—Cf. above
<a href="#line-V-i-25">l.&nbsp;28</a>, and Note; also Glapthorne’s <cite>Wit in a Constable</cite>, V, i:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="line i-8">“as easily as a Taylor</div>
<div class="line">Would do six hot loaves in a morning fasting,</div>
<div class="line">And yet dine after.”</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-90">V, i, 90</a>. <i>vse a conscience</i>—show or feel compunction; be tender-hearted.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-90">V, i, 91</a>. <i>hall</i>—a house or building belonging to a guild or fraternity
of merchants or tradesmen. At such places the business of the respective
guilds was transacted; and in some instances they served as the market-houses
for the sale of the goods of the associated members.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-95">V, i, 97</a>. <i>compleate Mounsieur</i>—perfect gentleman.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-i-100">V, i, 102</a>. <i>pantofle</i>—slipper; here used figuratively for: the shoe-maker’s
profession.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-ii-25">V, ii, 27</a>. <i>a barbarous Sythian</i>—Cf. Purchas’ <cite>Pilgrimage</cite> (ed. 1613, p.
333): “They [The Scythians] cut off the noses of men, and imprinted
pictures in the flesh of women, whom they overcame: and generally their
customes of warre were bloudie: what man soever the Scythian first
taketh, he drinketh his bloud: he offereth to the King all the heads of the
men he hath slaine in battell: otherwise he may not share in the spoile:
the skinnes of their crownes flaid off, they hang at their horse bridles:
their skinnes they use to flay for napkins and other uses, and some for
cloathing.... These customes were generall to the Scythians of Europe
and Asia (for which cause <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scytharum facinora patrare</i>, grew into a proverbe
of immane crueltie, and their Land was justly called Barbarous).”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-ii-40">V, ii, 40</a>. <i>made no hornes at me</i>—to “make horns” at any one was the
common method of taunting one with having horns,—i.&nbsp;e., with being a
cuckold.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-ii-50">V, ii, 51</a>. <i>made vp with</i>—set with the expression of.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-ii-100">V, ii, 102</a>. <i>by pieces</i>—in part.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-5">V, iii, 8</a>.—Charmi’s speech is addressed to Charalois, as is that of Du
Croy which follows it.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-15">V, iii, 18</a> ff.—M., f. insert <i>when</i> after <i>that</i> of l.&nbsp;18. This is probably
the correct reading. It would be possible, however, to let the line stand
without alteration, if the <i>that</i> of <a href="#line-V-iii-20">l.&nbsp;20</a> be taken as coordinate with the <i>that</i>
of l.&nbsp;18, introducing a second clause depending on <i>am sorry</i> (instead of
correlative with <i>so</i> to introduce a result-clause). With this reading, <i>left</i>
(<a href="#line-V-iii-20">l.&nbsp;22</a>) would be taken as an ellipsis for <i>being left</i>; with the emended
reading, for <i>was left</i>. Though the construction is in doubt, the sense is
easy.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-20">V, iii, 22</a>. <i>vndermine</i>—an object, <i>it</i>, is understood,—i.&nbsp;e., <i>the building
of my life</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-30">V, iii, 34</a>. <i>her—its</i> was rare in Elizabethan usage. Cf. Abbott, S.&nbsp;G.,
§§ 228, 229.</p>

<p><a id="page-159" href="#page-159" class="pagenum" title="159"> </a>
<a href="#line-V-iii-45">V, iii, 46</a>. <i>compassion of</i>—former obsolete construction for “compassion
for.” Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Henry VI, Part I</cite>, IV, i, 56; “Mov’d
with compassion of my country’s wreck.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-55">V, iii, 59</a>. <i>motion</i>—C., f. read <i>motion’s</i>,—an uncalled-for emendation,
since ellipsis of <i>is</i> was not infrequent. Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Henry V</cite>, IV, i,
197: “’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill [is] upon his own head.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-90">V, iii, 93</a>. <i>and yet the fault kept from me</i>—loose construction, not
easily parsed, though the sense is clear.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-95">V, iii, 98</a>. <i>As ... to vndergoe</i>—again a loose construction. It should
be, properly: <i>That ... he would undergo</i>, etc.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-105">V, iii, 107–9</a>. <i>like the fatall gold</i>, etc.—In this passage the two leaders
of the Gauls known to history by the same name appear to be confounded—(1):
Brennus, who sacked Rome in 390 B.&nbsp;C., and consented to withdraw
after receiving a large ransom of gold;—and (2): Brennus, who
led the irruption of the Gauls into Greece in the second century B.&nbsp;C.,
and attempted to despoil Delphi of its treasure, but did not succeed in
doing so. The fact that their respective expeditions are said to have
borne an immediate sequel of disaster and death for both alike, may be
responsible for the dramatist’s mistake.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-130">V, iii, 131</a>. <i>homicide</i>—formerly, as here, = <i>murderer</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-135">V, iii, 139</a>. <i>in way of</i>—in the manner of.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-140">V, iii, 144</a>. <i>the hate betweene his house and mine</i>—cf. <a href="#line-III-i-415">III, i, 416</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-165">V, iii, 166</a>. <i>more presumptions</i>—C., f. read <i>mere presumptions</i>, which
is probably correct. An alternative possibility should be noted, however:
that <i>presumptions</i> by mis-reading from the Ms. (or by the mere inversion
of a <i>u</i>) may be a mis-print for presumptious (presumptuous) = <i>presumptive</i>,
in which case <i>more</i> would be retained, with the passage to mean:
“You must find other proofs to strengthen these, and they must, moreover,
be of a nature to give more reasonable grounds for presumption.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-170">V, iii, 174–5</a>.—The last two lines of Charalois’ speech are addressed to
his judges; what preceded them to Novall.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-190">V, iii, 190</a>. <i>bands</i>—the emendation <i>bawds</i>, proposed by Coxeter and
followed by all subsequent editors, seems almost surely correct. “Bawd”
prior to 1700 was a term applied to men as well as—and, indeed, more frequently
than—to women. Cf. Shakespeare, <cite>Hamlet</cite>, I, iii, 130.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-190">V, iii, 190</a>. <i>tooke</i>—where the common Elizabethan custom of dropping
the <i>-en</i> inflectional ending of the past participle rendered a confusion
with the infinitive liable, the past tense of the verb was used for the
participle. Cf. Abbott, S.&nbsp;G., § 343.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-190">V, iii, 193</a>. <i>this matron</i>—i.&nbsp;e., Florimel.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-205">V, iii, 205</a>. <i>in Nouall</i>—i.&nbsp;e., “in the person of Novall.”</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-205">V, iii, 207</a>. <i>Thy challenge now I answere</i>—this phrase would indicate
that Romont crosses swords with Pontalier, and after a moment of
fencing runs him through; instead of striking him unawares, as the
modern stage direction, “<i>Stabs Pontalier</i>,” would imply.</p>

<p><a href="#line-V-iii-225">V, iii, 226</a>. <i>these—i.&nbsp;e.</i>, Aymer, Florimel, and Bellapert.</p>

<p><a id="page-160" href="#page-160" class="pagenum" title="160"> </a>
<a href="#courtiers-song"><i>Court. Song</i>, l.&nbsp;3</a>. first—i.&nbsp;e., “in the front part of,” to meet the customers
and be herself an attraction and an object of display, while the
husband remains “at tother end” (l.&nbsp;8) of the store.</p>

<p><a href="#courtiers-song"><i>Court. Song</i>, l.&nbsp;4</a>.—This is a most unduly long line. It seems probable
that, in the Ms. from which the play was printed, the three phrases, “A
faire wife,” “a kinde wife,” and “a sweet wife,” were <i>three variant</i> readings,
which, by mistake, were <i>all</i> incorporated in the text. Any one of
them used alone would give a perfectly normal line.</p>

<h2>Footnotes: Preface and Introduction</h2><!--TN: title added by transcriber-->

<div id="footnote-1" class="footnote">
<p><sup class="label">1</sup> Fleay (<cite>Chron. Eng. Dra.</cite>, I, 208) thinks that the otherwise lost Massinger
play, <cite>The Judge</cite>, licensed by Herbert in 1627, and included in the
list of Warburton’s collection, may have been <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>. He
declares, moreover, that “the decree in favor of creditors in I, ii <i>a</i> was
a statute made in 1623,” and suggests that Massinger after this date made
over an independent play of Field’s, now lost. But I think that any one
who surveys in <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> the respective hands of its authors will
incline strongly to the conviction that this drama is the offspring of joint
effort rather than the re-handling of one man’s work by another. The
decree to which Fleay has reference appears to be that to be found in
<cite>Statutes of the Realm</cite>, IV, ii, 1227–9, recorded as 21º Jac I, 19. This is
an act passed by the parliament of 1623–4; it somewhat increases the
stringency of the already-existing severe laws in regard to bankrupts, but
contains nothing which even faintly suggests the decree in our play, by
which the creditors are empowered to withhold the corpse of their debtor
from burial; and, indeed, it is obviously impossible that a statute permitting
any such practice could have been passed in Christian England
of the seventeenth century. The fact is that this feature of the plot is
taken direct from a classical author (see under <a href="#sources" class="smcap">Sources</a>), and it would
be gratuitous to assume in it a reference to contemporaneous legislation.
As for the hypothesis that <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> and <cite>The Judge</cite> are the same
play, in the utter absence of any supporting evidence it must be thrown
out of court. This sort of identification is a confirmed vice with Fleay.
<cite>The Judge</cite> is, moreover, listed as a comedy (see reprint of Warburton’s
list in Fleay’s <cite>The Life and Work of Shakespeare</cite>, p.&nbsp;358).&nbsp;<a href="#marker-1" class="return" title="Return to text">[↩]</a></p>

<p><sup class="label">2</sup> Two other arguments—both fallacious—have been advanced for a
more assured dating.</p>

<p>Formal prologues and epilogues came into fashion about 1620, and the
absence of such appendages in the case of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> has been
generally taken as evidence for its appearance before that year; but for
a Massinger production no such inference can be drawn—there is no
formal prologue or epilogue in any of his extant plays before <cite>The Emperor
of the East</cite> and <cite>Believe as You List</cite>, which were licensed for acting in
1631.</p>

<p>The suggestion (Fleay: <cite>Chron. Eng. Dra.</cite>, I, p.&nbsp;208) that Field took
the part of Florimel, and that the mention of her age as thirty-two years
(<a href="#line-II-ii-15">II, ii, 17</a>) has reference to his own age at the time the play was produced
(thus fixing the date: 1619), is an idea so far-fetched and fantastic
that it is amazing to find it quoted with perfect gravity by Ward (<cite>Hist.
Eng. Dra. Lit.</cite>, III, 39). That Field, second only to Burbage among the
actors of his time, should have played the petty role of Florimel is a
ridiculous supposition. It is strange that anyone who considered references
of this sort a legitimate clue did not build rather upon the statement
(<a href="#line-II-i-10">II, i, 13</a>) that Charalois was twenty-eight. But such grounds for
theorizing are utterly unsubstantial; there is no earthly warrant for
identifying the age of an author’s creation with the age of the author
himself.&nbsp;<a href="#marker-2" class="return" title="Return to text">[↩]</a></p>
</div>

<div id="footnote-3" class="footnote">
<p><sup class="label">3</sup> I would not, however, think it very improbable that Field might have
engaged in the composition of <cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite> immediately after his

altogether broken.&nbsp;<a href="#marker-3" class="return" title="Return to text">[↩]</a></p>

<p><sup class="label">4</sup> On a careful inspection of the entire dramatic output of Massinger,
both unaided work and plays done in collaboration, I have found worthy of

<p><sup class="label">6</sup> As witness <cite>The False One</cite>. Here Massinger seems to have projected
a stately historical drama of war and factional intrigue, with a conception
of Cleopatra as the Great Queen, more a Semiramis or a Zenobia
than “the serpent of old Nile,” and so treats his subject in the first and
last Acts; while Fletcher “assists” him by filling the middle section of
the play with scenes theatrically effective but leading nowhere, and in
them makes the heroine the traditional “gipsy” Cleopatra.&nbsp;<a href="#marker-6" class="return" title="Return to text">[↩]</a></p>

<p><sup class="label">7</sup> The only other modern attempt to apportion the play is that of C.
Beck (<cite>The Fatal Dowry</cite>, Friedrich-Alexander Univ. thesis, 1906, pp.&nbsp;89–94).
He assigns Massinger everything except the prose passages of <a href="#act-II-ii">II, ii</a>
and <a href="#act-IV-i">IV, i</a>, and perhaps <a href="#line-II-i-90">II, i, 93–109</a>. His <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> theory of distribution
seems to be that all portions of the play which he deems of worth must

of the part his man was doing) repeated without loss of time, “Come
here this moment you Son of a Whore or I’ll break all the bones in your

jumped up with all his sables about him, which unfortunately were tied
to the handles of the bier and dragged after him—but this was not all—the
laugh and roar began in the audience and frightened poor Warren so
much that with the bier at his tail he threw down Calista and overwhelmed
her, with the table, lamp, books, bones, &amp;c.—he tugged till he broke off his
trammels and made his escape, and the play at once ended with immoderate
fits of laughter—Betterton would not suffer The Fair Penitent to
